I have quit my job that paid $67,000 a year with medical benefits due to the harrassment and threat of termination from my former supervisor due to his actions that costs the my former company thousands of dollars. Had I stayed, I would’ve been fired to save the company money. In either case, I have been denied unemployment which has resulted me in losing my apartment, car, and food. I have been denied access to all social saftey net programs because I have simply made the decision to quit rather than be fired. I have been without a job for 5 months now even though I am a highly skilled and hard working employee. My income tax of over $2500 has been seized to pay a school loan as well as child support. I have absolutely no income, due to the laws of this country that has made sure people like me have no access to public housing, medical care, or financial assistance. Although things for me have not been the greatest, I will not give up my rights as a human being to live, fight, and change things for the better for myself and people like me who are in my situation. My situation has strengthened my resolve in making sure that I can bring change to a country where change is severely needed. Our politicians need to listen to people without money, instead of people with an overabundance of it. We live in a country where there are empty homes, and homeless people; 24 hour grocery stores with men, women and children are starving to death; Universities that lack students yet millions of potential minds seeking an education; and a Federal Reserve that has countless funds of money yet millions of people in extreme and severe poverty.

My life is not horrible but I am angered by my situation.I work for a corporation that gives me very few rights (posting this I can actually get fired if I disclose the name of the company or myself).I work long hours for straight commission.  My company can change my commission rates at anytime they desire. I am forced to work even when the store is not open for no hourly wage. If I don’t make minimum wage in a given pay period they will pay me minimum wage but the next time I make more money than minimum wage I have to pay them back.I have very limited health insurance with outrageous deductibles and after paying for it and paying income tax many of my bi-weekly  paychecks are less than four hundred dollars and this is a full-time job!If I want to make more money I need to move to a salaried position. I have witnessed many friends attempt to do this and they are slaves that have difficulty balancing personal life with the over abundance of hours and demands put on them.The corporation is too cheap to hire  more workers to make salaried workers jobs less demanding. They can not retain good quality employees because they refuse to pay more than minimum wage unless you are on commission or are salaried. I am smart and a very quick learner but refuse to put myself in thousands of dollars in debt to get a piece of paper that says I am qualified.I am very creative but any job that I see that I could possibly make a decent income at and be happy doing it needs a degree.Many people I went to high school with have gone to college and have associate degrees which mean almost as much as a high school diploma in today’s job market.The ones with bachelor degrees are lucky if they have jobs that pay enough to make a dent in their educational debt. These people still owe thousands of dollars to be a slave. They are no better off than I (I actually have an edge on them by not having tens of thousands of dollars in debt).I am a slave to society. I work to make money and I can barely afford to live.

I do not have my other children. I had to give up rights to my son, who is now 4 and I have never met, because I could not afford to pay the child support. I have tried to reach out to get the help I need from every angle possible and to every agency I know of that could help. I have not been helped by any of them. The below is what I have even sent to online help sites to obtain help. I still have not found any help from any of them.“I really need help. I am a single father with full custody of my nine month old baby girl. I am struggling right now, financially; among other things. I will tell you about what is going on. I am fighting for disability due to physical and mental problems. I do receive food stamps of $367 per month, cash assistance of $316 (which will be going to $100 within the next six months) and WIC checks for Savannah. This isn’t enough to obtain housing. I cannot find any housing with the county (Lackawanna County; Scranton, Pennsylvania) or within surrounding counties. I have tried all the agencies that help with such matters. Child Support does not come from the mother as she is on SSI, according to domestics. I have no other income.I have lived at three addresses since Savannah was born. All three have bedbugs and fleas. I am tired of it. If something happens here, I have no where else to go. I have been forced to lie and say that I am residing somewhere else just to keep my welfare benefits because the other people I lived with and live with now have a high income and it would be counted.I don’t know what to do. (Barred from jobs due to criminal record, lack of transportation, fainting risks, lack of experience, lack of education; and no other way to pay for our needs. I get so depressed because I am failing as a father. It is my duty to provide for her and yet I can’t. I have gotten so bad that I actually want to die, 90% of the time.I don’t know what kind of help you can provide, but any help is appreciated.”Some things have changed since those emails. I now reside in my fourth residence since my daughter was born. I am soon to be going through court again for my 7 year old daughter who I have not had any rights to see this far. I have been denied again for disability and now have given up. I have no education, no way to obtain education, no car, no way to get one, can’t drive anyway, no skills for labor, limitations on my labor abilities, no bank accounts, no inheritances, no trust funds, nothing to speak of except that I am on welfare.

I spent 4 years earning an associate degree in broadcasting (paid by the state) which did not get me a job in radio or TV. All the commercial TV stations in my city of Peoria have consolidated and seem to prefer Big Ten and Missouri Valley Athletic Conference grads. So I went 2 years earning by bachelor in business administration (paid by loans at a small private college) which I do not regret despite I can’t get a job as an administrative assistant due to “lack of experience”. I live paycheck to paycheck as a temp at a Catholic hospital, donate plasma, and go can collecting to make ends meet.I’ve worked jobs through federal work-study, seasonal, and temporary since college and once in my life was laid off after the economy took a crap. The hospital won’t hire me on saying “come back when you have a more stable work history”. The IRS ripped me off on my 2011 taxes because my past employer (a call center for Verizon Telecom) must have fucked up my W-4. I only have $1,000 in savings and am planning to get out of Peoria in search of better opportunities. I only have over-the-air television, eat beans & rice every weekend, and do not need an expensive cell phone plan. I haven’t been able to take an actual vacation because of bills and $22,000 student loan debt and even though I have a job and donate plasma, it’s not enough.This comes to my conclusion: Why do the rich and the well-off get to have all the fun and benefits while people like me and my boyfriend have to suffer? Employers should NOT hire people based on what college they attended and how are people supposed to get experience when companies won’t give them a chance? In addition I still haven’t gotten over missing our California trip in 2010 despite US Airways refunded our return ticket money. My boyfriend’s well-off parents live there and we were supposed to see them. Nowadays it seems his father doesn’t want our presence because we’re not married with children or have a ton of money or something (BTW he was going to help pay for our visit too). With the way America is going, I’m not sure if I should become a momma someday; maybe instead raise unwanted dogs and cats. Yes I am jealous, insecure, bitchy, and pissed off because America thinks the poor are freeloaders wanting a handout or are a bunch of marijuana smoking hippies who live in their parent’s basement. That’s bullshit!

Our medical premiums continue to rise, doubling this past year, as our out of pocket expenses exponentially increase. This while the insurance company cries poor and posts quarter profits in the billions.   Still, I consider myself very lucky to have what I have. I am deeply concerned with what has transpired in this country for the last thirty years.  Our country was once known for its commitment of upward mobility and the “American Dream.” That commitment has been called into question as more of us struggle to make ends meet on whatever meager incomes we garner. Many of us are facing a crisis in confidence in many of our personal and professional lives. It has been said that great civilizations die from suicide rather than homicide. What we are experiencing is the hijacking of our political system from the corporate oligarchs that have swayed the judicial and legislative process for decades and have thus created a plutocracy where malfeasance is a common occurrence. Our current economy favors consumption over production; debt over saving; and self-indulgence over altruism. We Americans must insist on complete transparency, clarity and accessibility when it comes to conglomerates dictating policy and procedure. This goes for K-street as well as Wall Street. The first step in overhauling the mores and values of Wall Street is setting up a system of checks and balances that would make the framers of our constitution proud.  All corporate entities that were on the receiving end of the bailouts should be subjected to unilateral fiscal and management audits conducted by reputable & independent firms. These audits would not only track every transaction, settlement, and agreement; it would disseminate where money went and to whom. The mantra of “trust but verify” would echo the halls of all federated entities that have parlayed public monies. However, it would be naive to think that pure unadulterated accountability would ever happen in our current capitalistic paradigm where it’s every man for himself; capitalism without a conscience; and profits before the people. As Lord Action once stated: “Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.” The next step towards reform is to bring government back to “We the People” … Not, We the Directorate. Both political parties have contorted and blended themselves into an amalgam of dishonesty and distrust that depend on the deep pockets of big business.  Lobbyists have taken away the principle of “one person one vote” and have rigged and exploited the political process to the detriment of the Middle Class. In 2009, over 13,700 registered lobbyists spent well over 3.5 billion dollars to control and manipulate the legislative process. That comes out to 6.5 million dollars for each legislative member. I have learned from OWS that change comes from within, that democracy is not a spectator sport and that we all need to get into the game.  I want to believe that we can create a fair and equatable capitalistic environment where everyone can be held to the same standard, no matter how much money they have.  We have always taught our children to work hard, be honest, have integrity and they will succeed in life.  That is no longer true.  The people who succeed lie, cheat, and steal at any cost to advance in life. That’s why I am proud to be part of the 99%.

I found it in a newspaper with OWS as the cover story.Who ever you are, I understand. We are hurting, too.“Growing up, I constantly saw my mother overcome financially extreme adversities. My father abused my mother daily, but she was strong. She fought back. Once left with a house with no degree, no job, and myself at 8 years old. She became determined. In a span of 5 years, she in a job that was paying her 50,000 annually. But over that time, she was constantly laid off. Multiple times of extreme stress, also on me. Dealing with an emotionally unavailable father, and financial problems burden a burden for me.  My mother lost plenty of times. So why, why if she gained alot as well, why doesn’t it seem enough? An honest, hardworking single mother with a house and two children. With financial burdens the banks seemed to make a mockery of. Why is it, that I cannot attend college because we can’t “afford” it?   I’m not trying to make a pity party for myself, but we need to WAKE UP. The more I look around at the biggest problems we face, the easier it is to think of an obvious solution. But people seem willfully ignorant. And that bothers me.     So much wrong doing in the world, while we settle for “just because.” What have people become? To put profit over the people? How addicting is money, and when is it enough for you?  When an innocent Iranian child dies? When an honest, hardworking, middle class resident who can’t keep up with the bills anymore? When?    Because I have been looking for an answer. I am angry. Angry, AT US. For allowing this to be. Also upset because it hit me personally. I feel like the United States will completely disintegrate in my lifetime.   But why? Ask yourselves, why. Why does this have to be? If we didn’t know about this corruption, it’s one thing. But when it’s in our faces, why do we still choose to accept it?  As my mom is one missed check away from losing everything, I wonder why too.                                                       99%","2012-01-06",3,0.330578512396694,0.0991735537190083,0.413223140495868,0.15702479338843,"129.900029892894","176.193759315091","0.737256701927741","negative"

After that, we dodged 5 foreclosures in 3 years.My employer was bought by a public company this year. We now are being told we need to cut costs next year. Hours will be cut, and there will be an increase in our Health Insurance contribution. This will likely mean a new (read: cheaper) Ins. plan and an increase in my co-pays as well.I have seen this happen before when i worked retail.Apparently our profit ratios are off from the accepted norms made by stock analysts.

I volunteered to go to Iraq because the mainstream media led me to believe the US was building schools and hospitals. Shortly after entering the military despite my extensive construction experience I was trained how to shoot to kill and blow up buildings using minimal amounts of explosives. Around my 7th month in Iraq I realized we were not building schools and hospitals but instead enforcing laws the general public were uninformed of. It was at this time I began to internally side with the iraqi people and ever since have been afraid to speak up for the people around the world the USA oppresses for the sake of cheap oil and profits for banks and department stores for fear of being branded a traitor and terrorist. I have attempted suicide out of shame for being a part of a world war/domination in which there is no end in sight. Due to my injuries I am on VA disability and continue to live in fear that if I speak my mind on all of the horrible things the American government does to people all over the world the government will take my disability pay since I am unfit to work.

To The Patriot Act being one of the most inhuman laws in free society.To the fact that anytime there is a study on casualties of war the count is always “this many American troops” and “this many iraqis” but never “This many human beings” which only divides us human beings as a whole.

As normal workers we just can’t afford vacation homes all over the world as the government would like us to, so we do not qualify as human enough to remain together.This isn’t the first time the machine has done this to my family and my people under different guises. Over the last century they have tried to (and have succeeded with some family members) to gas us, freeze us to death, starve us to death, steal our land, take our country, put us in concentration camps on two continents, put us on forced reservations, and now this- forced homelessness to meet the needs of the paperwork.My family and my people have been dehumanized by the machine over the years due to status, race, creed, and origins. I have watched as the machine has forced my neighbors into slavery in prisons because of nothing but the color of their skin.Previously, the family members that survived have fled, hid, and lied to protect their lives. Now it’s my turn. I choose truth. I choose to turn around and stand up to the machine, knowing full well that whatever the court may be called, I am facing a death panel, the same one that has been trying to annihilate my family for a century at least.  Knowing that a killer cannot be reasoned with. Knowing that a machine with no soul will never be able to recognize humanity in a person with a soul and a pulse.I followed all of its rules like a sheep, tried following its commands, when its paperwork was messed up I took the weight of it and suffered for it. When I could have worked to free myself I did not, because its rules told me I was not allowed to work. I fairly well shot myself in the foot to blindly obey it. And now when I am bleeding and asking for one line of bandage for the wounds I have sustained obeying it, it kicks me in the shin and throws my children to the wolves. I can imagine my people went into the gas chambers in much the same way, having hope that the machine would show a soul, hope that if they just obeyed that it would be kind, but all the obeying did was end their lives.Am I crazy to face it, or am I fed up? It threatens my husband and my children. If it were just threatening me, maybe I would do the sane thing and run like my surviving ancestors before me. But the anger and protective instinct when a murderer tries to attack my family is too much. I cannot back down. If they do not cease to light the fire in their gas chambers, I will drag them down into the flames with me.

Reading the stories of others. Relating to some, crying for others & being thankful that, although I face my own struggles & fight my own battle, it is not as burdensome as others. I am 37 years old. I have spent the majority of my adult life disenchanted & angry because my grandparents taught me that the “American Dream: was achievable. Yet, no matter how hard I’ve tried, I’ve been unable to achieve mine. As much as I miss my grandparents & could truly use their wisdom in my life right now (not to mention their warm hugs, love & family bond), I am glad that they did not live long enough to witness the destruction of the country & ideals that they fought for. I know they would be heartbroken to learn that faith, loyalty & heard work are no longer valued & rewarded in America.  Last year, at a time in my life where it would seem all hope was lost, I chose to believe that my grandparents were right when they told me that I could do anything & be anything, as long as I was willing to do the work to achieve my goals. So, I took a leap of faith & I moved my family into a new apartment, despite having no job, & I began the process of getting myself re-enrolled in cosmetology school. I chose to follow my passion & my dream. I found a new job & accepted a wage far below that which I am accustomed to, but found a way to make it work. I lived on a tight budget & slowly began to climb back out of (some of) my debt. I started school & began to have hope, once more, that I really could achieve everything I dreamed of. But now the debt is mounting again. When you’re forced to live on a budget & can’t afford to put money into savings, all it takes is one unexpected expense to push you back out into the deep in, struggling to tread water. So now I am back at square one, trying to find a way to move forward. I’m living paycheck to paycheck, supporting 2 teenage boys (one in college!) on an income I haven’t had to live off of since 2000! Earlier in the year we qualified for food stamps (a little relief), but now that my oldest is 18 they want to count his part time job as “household income” & factor his $400 per month into our budget. Still waiting to hear back on that, but I have a feeling this will push us over the “poverty line” & we’ll lose that little bit of assistance. I receive child support for my 15 year old, but the meager $346 per month ($250 court ordered + $96 to go towards the over $6000 in arrears from when he quit paying for 2 years) is hardly 1/2 the cost of raising a child. I have mounting medical expenses & need a surgery that I can’t afford (despite having decent insurance). And recently my 15 year old’s depression took  turn for the worse, prompting me to seek out more “specialized” therapy, which (of course) is not covered by his insurance & is costing me $115 per session, out of pocket. Through all of this I am watching the company I work for slowly dissolve & I fear it will eventually go under. When I accepted my position last December I became the 4th person in a department that really could have used 5 people. Today we are down to 2 people - me & my former supervisor. She was demoted & her pay severely cut… “restructuring”. She’ll be gone soon, just leaving me. They won’t re-hire. And the likelihood of receiving a raise in pay to compensate for the growing work load is extremely slim. I just hope the company holds on until I can finish school. But again…. there are people worse off than me. I know this. I remind myself of this every single day. But how am I supposed to give my sons hope for their futures & instill in them even a glimmer of the faith that my grandparents instilled in me when there are no longer examples to point to of men & women who worked hard & believed in themselves & achieved their dreams… successfully? How am I supposed to convince my depressed 15 year old son that their is something worth fighting for & that we really are some of the “lucky” ones?","2011-11-25",4,0.189393939393939,0.113636363636364,0.28030303030303,0.416666666666667,"253.790325648631","286.652506141475","0.885358823701944","negative"

But I was not as lucky as most preemies. I was born 3 months early weighing 1 pound 9 ounces. Preemies usually pass away within the first 2 weeks, but not I! I stayed strong for my mommy and daddy, as they had to be strong for me. My mommy was medically discharged from the Army so she used the GI Bill to get her nursing degree. Her only income was her monthly housing allowance. Once I was born mommy had to put school on hold. I was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit attached to a ventilator and numerous other machines. Mommy held my hand and sung with me. My daddy is a very special man. He left his job to go work for a company that offered better insurance. The drawback was the hours he would have to work to provide for us. We would hang out together at the hospital until he left for work and then he would come back up for bath time, and occasionally we even got sleep overs.  It was great!My mommy and daddy don’t like handouts, but we preemies automatically receive Medicaid as a secondary insurance. Since daddy didn’t get his new job until after I was born no one knew who would be picking up the enormous bill. Mommy and daddy were told quiet often that it could be them. It began to eat at them. You could read it in their faces.  They struggled to spend all their time with me, but “time is money”. It took money to put gas in the car, food on the table, keep bills out of the red. It drained my mommy and daddy.I passed away after a battle with pneumonia on September 20, 2011.They did everything they could to give me a beautiful spot on this earth, but they both had to turn to their parents and ask for money to bury me. They are only one paycheck away from getting my headstone ordered! (I would like to thank the ladies at memorials.com that have been helping us, you ladies are great.) This is not what my mommy and daddy thought becoming a parent would be like, but they are lucky. Today they found out that Medicare has covered all my hospital expenses! Today we found out, that when utilized appropriately, government programs work. We are lucky Medicare wasn’t abolished before I was born or my parents would have their last memory of me be a hospital bill. Mommy still can’t find a job and daddy’s income doesn’t cover everything, but they are strong and they will make it.WE ARE THE 99%.","2011-11-19",1,0.84375,0.01875,0.13125,0.00625,"65.8122274074399","52.5461125875021","1.25246615147498","neutral"

I wish I could celebrate it with her, but I don’t know where she is.My mother is homeless. I have no way to reach her. She is in need of serious mental help. She has cut off all contact with me for almost a year now, believing that I am an FBI informant working against her.The last time I saw her was almost six months ago. I tried to have her involuntarily committed. The ER said that she didn’t qualify. I was deathly afraid for my physical and emotional health the whole time. Even if I could find her now, I would be too afraid to bring her home with me. I believe she really would hurt me.I shouldn’t have to choose between my own safety and my mother’s.There is NO help for people like her.As for me, I know how lucky I am to be 25 with a BA, minimal debt and an $8.75/hr full time job (in a town I despise) that just barely manages to pay rent and food. I don’t have a TV or internet. I live simply. If I eat nothing but ramen for the next month, I might be able to afford Christmas presents. But I could never save up enough to pay for treatment for my mom.Her illness took my childhood home. It took her car, her sanity, and any hope of employment she may have had. I’m all she has anymore. And I can’t help her.I’m lucky I at least have health insurance so that I was able to obtain cheap generic antidepressants in order to keep functioning just enough to not lose my job.

Our government is every part as responsible for this system break down. Our own Congress cannot reach an agreement on how much of a paycut to give themselves, but have no issue doling it out to the rest of the country. Our generation, and our children’s generation will fit the bill for this greed. Universities are also to blame. The amount of money that is poured into education never makes it to education or our educators. Instead the adminitration continues to let their accounts swell, while the teachers and staff have to face pay cuts, furlough days, and loss of benefits. The students suffer the most. How are we supposed to further our education and careers, when we aren’t even given a chance, just piles of debt that continue to accrue each month?

Monthly income: $1000. Monthly Bills: $600-$1000 a month (depending on what I want to actually pay that month) $285 for student loans alone… my sister, eight years older then I am, pays $50…. I’m forced to live with my parents, which is an unhealthy environment for me and my son.MAXIMUM amount of monthly income to qualify for state health insurance: $399. Last time I had health insurance, I was in highschool.I work at home for rich clients who refuse to pay their bills, even though we’ve given them a 30% discount on what I call the “dollar store of web development companies”, and think they have the right to treat you like their slave.I get no credit, nor do I get paid for, my time spent software engineering, improving client’s businesses with MY ideas, troubleshooting, solving business issues or consulting. I make almost $15,000/year for a job I should be getting twice as much for.I have an IQ of 140. I graduated with a 3.95 GPA in computer science, the only reason it was this low was because I had an issue with a teacher that gave me a bad grade. He was later fired, I wasn’t the only one with an issue with him….. How well I did in school, or how smart I am on technical tasks… means nothing.I struggle with social anxiety and depression. I can’t make eye contact and do not do well in social situations with strangers, especially job interviews. Cheap medications, that aren’t working, is a necessary monthly bill.I am over 100 lbs overweight and have pre-diabetes and heart disease with no health insurance or care. I have no energy to diet or exercise and have an overly rambunctious three year old to keep track of and make sure he’s not trying to jump out the second story window again today while I attempt to work.I’ve had surgery on my right hand twice, once for carpal tunnel release, the second, to fix the first surgery, which was botched by an inexperienced doctor, whom I still owe. I have about 20% use of my hands. I was denied workman’s comp for life, they offered $500 to pay for the lawyer, which he waived, I had to sign the papers, 6 months later, because I had been unemployed for over 3 years already and needed the money.I feel I have maybe 3-5 more years before I cannot use my hands anymore and am forced to file disability. The idea of this disgusts me. Physcial therapy could extend that to at least 20 years… there is no assistance available to do this.I am $60,000 in student loan debt. $225 out of the $285 monthly bill is purely for interest. $20,000 of those loans, that aren’t federal, haven’t been paid on for 8 years, I am hoping no one notices. If you’re in default, you are not eligible for the income based repayment plan which could make them below $100 a month… According to the calculator, mine would be $15/month… you need to be in recovery for a year, I paid $315 a month for a year in order to be eligible for this. This does not make sense to me. If I could have afforded to pay for the loans in the first place… I wouldn’t be needing the IBR!!!!!!!!!!!! Fun fact: after delaying them for 6 years, I was only 2 months late on payment to get into default.I have been trying for the last 4 years to save $2000 to file bankruptcy for $5000-$10000 medical debt. It still hasn’t happened.I’m about to add thousands of dollars in medical debt for dental work for my son, who needs to see a specialist due to his age (3)…. It may be his christmas present this year. I hope he’ll appreciate it when he’s older, that is, if I pay for it, I doubt I will.Two months ago my bank account was emptied of $1400 by court order (that i was served for 4 years ago on the day I was in labor and delivery), it took me a year to save that much, to pay for an eleven year old medical bill that was $200 to begin with. The money in my bank was mostly child support… It’s illegal for a creditor to take child support from you. I had no time or any money left to dispute it. I could not get away from work or my son, in order to file the claim that I had all of 7 days to dispute, and I was not notified it had happened until 3 days after the fact. I was lucky I was able to pay that student loan bill that month. I had only a few dollars left in my account.I have been trying for the last 4 years to save $2000 to file bankruptcy for $5000-$10000 medical debt.

The picture that is up is the only one I have on my pc, and it is of my mother the year she died. I will tell you my story and that of my family as well, however.In 2002, my mother became ill and went to the doctor but because she had no insurance at the time (she and my step father hadn’t married yet) they deduced that she was just after drugs and sent her home. A few months later, after she was married thank god, my step father carried my very ill mother into the ER and they finally told her that she had cancer and that her kidneys were shutting down. They misdiagnosed her twice with the cancer: first thinking it was Hodgekins Lymphoma and then telling her it was non-hodgekins before realizing that she had one of the more rare forms of Lymphoma. It’s called Null-Cell. It’s a blend of the two Lymphoma’s above and impossible to treat. She had a 10% chance of surviving the chemo but without it, she had no chance to live. She fought for two years and battled with SS offices over getting disabilty when she had several doctors tell them she would never be able to work. They refused. Why? Because she worked the year she found out she was dying. In Dec. 2004, my mother, a woman who lived through abusive relationships, parents and fought to live through cancer succumbed to the overwhelming odds of her disease. She lived a year and a half beyond what they told her she would. The day she died, the SS office called and said they’d finally approved her because she’d been out of work for at least a year due to her cancer. I told them not to bother, she would no longer be needing the 20 years of hard factory labor she put into it.Later that next year I was diagnosed with RA. I worked in a nursing home. I’d been working there for years. The doctor told me that I would not be able to walk by the time I was 40 if I did not do something else for a job. Something lighter perhaps, like a secretary. I couldn’t quit my job for one I had no training for so I continued. In 2007, I injured myself at work. Their doctor said it was not work related, even though I had been running round on the floor taking care of 74 patients practically by myself (the other two aides were on light duty) I tried to claim my right to a second opinion but my doctor would not see me because I owed her money. No health insurance sucks when you need it, let me tell you. I was forced to quit my job because my injury prevented me from being able to walk with out crutches for several weeks.Honestly, now, thinking back… I’m happy I quit. If I had not quit, my brother aged 19 at the time, would most likely be dead right now. In Jan. of 2008, he had a brain aneurysm right in front of me. Scariest thing I’ve ever had happen to me and I worked in healthcare. You never think that it’ll happen to you. This kind of shit happens to everyone else but you but like my mother before him having the rarest form of cancer…. he had to have something rare too. We joke about it now sort of. We try to. I remember carrying him to the car to get him to the hospital and thinking… my mother’s baby is dying…. and I can’t do anything.My brother has a permanent seizure disorder and an anxiety problem because of the Aneurysm. He can not be left alone because he gets about 20 seconds warning before he seizes and can only helplessly yell for help. His seizures are too dangerous to leave him on his own. He is 23. He has SSI, my mother’s SSDB and foodstamps. He’s only allowed partial benefits because he gets my mother’s SS death benefits. So he recieves about $674 a month and $90 in FS a month to live on. We live in Government Housing. According to them I’m not allowed to get a part time job, date, go outside, or take classes to improve our situation because it’s their policy that caretakers are not allowed to have their own agenda. I’m being threatened with eviction. Not him, just me because I went to classes for a semester. 4 hours a week and in which case I had someone come to the house while I was gone to stay with him. Which housing also does not allow unless they approve the person first. My brother has panic attacks around my grandmother, much less a stranger. I’m the only one he’s really comfortable with. If they evict me there is no one else and he won’t be able to handle a stranger coming in. It’s either I leave him on his own, find a bigger house (which we can’t pay the rent for) or we will both be in the street.I am 28 years old. I have 15k in medical bills, at the moment 4k in student bills and I have no health insurance because I have to be a refugee or pregnant to qualify for medicaid. I’m not allowed FS because I’m classified as a student. I’m not allowed to work because the housing says it’s government policy that I never leave my house without my brother in tow.My entire family is the 99%, stand the hell up.p.s. my grandmother has worked since she was 13. She has paid her taxes, votes like a good little american, and is 72 years old. She isn’t able to retire and still works because her SS is less than she made working and can’t cover her bills. It isn’t just our gen or the next that’s paying for this…. it’s everyone.","2011-10-29",1,0.785714285714286,0.214285714285714,0,0,"159.517916003661","294.98937577876","0.540758173349601","negative"

Since the United States does not offer a “real” maternity leave I had to return to work a few weeks after her birth, putting her in daycare before she was even 3 months old. Quality daycare is like paying a second mortgage; it ranges between 1000 and 1800 a month. We could not afford for one of us to stay home but after childcare expenses we were barely getting by.  Three weeks after returning to work, the company I was working for went bankrupt. I am unemployed. I have no health benefits. I do not qualify for government assistance because I live with my significant other and we make “too much money”.

My husband went to college but the only way he can now work in his field is outside of this country, he was laid off and we count our blessings that he found some other work.  I have bad health, but good insurance, but insurance we can barely afford (or I should say, can’t afford as we are choosing it over many basic needs).  I guess I am very fortunate in this country at this time.Financially, my husband is worth more to me dead than alive. We have sold all our family heirlooms that are worth anything. Now we are selling off stuff that we use every day, furniture, pots and pans and etc… I want to have more kids but we can’t afford it. I want to move, but I can’t sell my house. I don’t feel free. I feel trapped!My doctor said I need to be on a special diet, but I can’t afford the food it requires to make me healthy. We now eat Ramon noodles, oatmeal and peanut butter on white bread. I don’t tell my husband, but I often don’t eat to make sure everyone else in the family does. I am hungry. We make “too much money” for help. A friend who qualifies to get food at a local church gives us the stuff they don’t like, like black-eye peas. This is the best day of the month! An old client of mine brings us meat and old bread every once in a while that the grocery store can’t sell because of the dates. I had to quit a job I did have because I couldn’t afford the gas or daycare -While doing this as a mom to an infant I had to leave the house at 5 AM and didn’t get home until 9-10 PM, 6 DAYS A WEEK. The pay only covered our fuel bill and daycare. I am educated.We watched our family dog die because we could not afford the vet bill.My parents lost their business, my great grandmother’s property, and their house is in foreclosure and they will be moving in with us. We have a small home. My mom and dad are both sickly, have no insurance, no retirement, no pension and no savings. What will we do?","2011-10-29",1,0.682926829268293,0.225609756097561,0,0.0914634146341463,"135.571633469186","138.687397682591","0.977533905275688","negative"

I can’t buy my own insurance because of my pre-existing conditions. I have been out of school for 3 years and I STILL cannot find a full employment job, because, according to hiring managers, I don’t have enough experience. I am stuck in a low-paying government contract position with no benefits. The company that holds my contract is skimming extra money out of my paycheck for reasons unknown, and when confronted for an explanation, told me to shut up and if I didn’t like it, find another job. Oh, and they CUT MY PAY EVEN FURTHER for speaking up. And I am trapped. I have nowhere else to go right now because I haven’t been able to get another job yet.I did everything I was supposed to do. I went to school and got a good education. I got my degree and moved to an area where jobs are supposed to be easier to find. The only credit card I have is for my medical expenses. I live within my means; I’m not a big spender. Yet I’m still living paycheck to paycheck, and I have no idea how I’m going to continue to pay my living expenses, medical bills, and somehow find a way to pay for grad school in order to get the further skills necessary to get a “real job,” because apparently a bachelor’s degree doesn’t cut it anymore.

We spend most of his employed months playing catch-up.My mother has breast cancer. We just received the news that I have a 60% chance of developing the same cancer before 50 due to a genetic mutation that we both have.

All I’ve wanted to do since high school is to be an English teacher. I need at least a Bachelor’s degree to do so, which means university. I’ll be the first generation of my family to do so, and I want to be proud of that. But at $16,000 a semester, by the time I’m done with college and credentialing, I’ll have at least $100,000 in debt, all that so I can throw my hat into an increasingly small pool of available teaching positions, and yearly decreasing wages for teachers. I live in a state and a country that is supposed to provide the “most affordable” higher education. I’d like to own a vehicle some day, and maybe pay the rent on time just once and still be able to eat. But I can’t even get a “burger flipping” job because I’m “overqualified” and “over-educated.” Most of the people my age are the same way. We aren’t lazy, we aren’t hippies. We are passionate about what we want to do, but we don’t have much hope left that we can. We Are the 99%I’d like to add that I’ve been told pretty much from the get-go, in relation to those degrees I’ve paid so much for, that they will be “worth less than the paper they are printed on.” This has been repeated to me many times, in the same way that common knowledge is repeated. I don’t want to accept that I’ve sunken myself in debt getting degrees I needed to have for three pieces of paper that serve no purpose except to open the gateway to more debt, and another couple of pieces of paper that by the time I’m done with University will be about the same.There’s this assumption that people make that those of us that go to community college are just wasting our time and resources. That those of us that choose to drop out lose very little in the process. I beg to differ. There are a lot of people who were told in High School that Community level college was the way to go in regards to affordability in getting the general education requirements for a degree out of the way. In addition, we were led to believe that by acquiring that general education, it would ensure us entrance to a higher level college that so many of us could not afford and weren’t eligible for scholarships for at the time. Sound familiar? We got led by the nose here, and to give up the pursuit in favor of change that, let’s be completely honest, might not come about is truly a sacrifice that I can respect. Financial aid was designed to help those students who cannot balance a job and schooling. But many of us discovered, as I did, that even with a job, financial aid, and loans, it’s not enough. I managed three years in a run-down apartment, eating basically mac-and-cheese all the time with three other people, and I still could never pay the bills on time. I tell people that because there seems to be a curious assumption that we are somehow coasting on our parent’s money and time. Hate to break the hard news, but average cost of living where I am, and this is with no internet and no phone, is still over $1000. I am willing to bet hard cash, which I have very little of now, that it’s the same situation in more than just my town.But what hurts the worst is knowing that I’m not the only one who is sailing in this sinking boat. I know so many of my peers what are just as passionate, just as educated, and just as motivated to succeed as I am and as anyone I’ve ever known. But I can tell you right now that a lot of them are never going to see those dreams, and we’re all losing out because of it. The future is getting siphoned away, and it’s time for a change.We are the 99%.","2011-10-26",4,0.0485436893203883,0,0.281553398058252,0.669902912621359,"243.266691808419","183.144334591256","1.328278553368","neutral"

I knew it was completely out of my budget, with no college fund set up for me, and a family that couldn’t help pay for my education, but I decided to take the leap regardless because I know that in America, the name on your degree MATTERS. 2 years later, I can no longer afford the school and my parents can no longer cosign my loans due to bad credit scores. Despite almost $40,000 total in scholarships, I still owe over $100,000 in student loans for those 2 years ALONE. I am now attending and will graduate from a state university that I commute to daily. I live at home, a different home from where I grow up in. After 20 years of living in a moderately-sized 3-bedroom house for a 6-person family, we had to move temporarily to a cheaper rented house so we could put ours on the market. Despite setting a very low buying point, we have had no takers. If nobody buys the house within the next month or so, it will be foreclosed on, and the investment of the past 20 years will be gone. We can’t afford to rent here for long either, so I don’t know where my family (of 6, may I remind you) will go.I am LUCKY, and STILL SCREWED and TERRIFIED for my future! This is what the 99% is about. When you work as hard as my parents, paying to LIVE should not be this difficult. I’m not religious, but I still pray that I’ll be able to get a job out of college that will allow me to repay my loans while affording to move out on my own.

My GPA when I graduated from high school was a 3.1. My high school guidance counselor found a scholarship from the college I wanted to go to that is worth $20,000 per year and she said I qualified for it. I called an admissions counselor at the college and she told me I only have a 2.7 according to the college standards. Music does not count as a credit in the eyes of the college. So, I needed over $23,000 in loans and my dad is helping as much as he can. He gets laid off of work at times, especially in the winter, so it can be rough for him. Both of my parents have never attended college and I am the first child to do so.     I had a job over the summer and during my senior year of high school. I was available many days to work but they would give me a maximum of 3 days a week, even after I stated my availability. My mom gave me a 2000 Rav4 when I got my license and the job barely helped me pay my insurance and gas and anything else I needed. Now in college, I was unable to keep the same job due to distance. It has taken me almost three months to find a new job and I finally got one only because my dad’s girlfriend knows the right people. My dad has helped me as best as he can these past few months, which I am grateful for.   I wish I had gone to a state school instead but my dream is to be a clinical psychologist and the internship program at the college I am attending has exactly what I need to achieve my goals for my future. I hope I will be able to pay off my loans but it is so high, it will take so long and many more struggles will be along the way.  I am the 99 percent.  occupywallst.org","2011-10-21",4,0.0388349514563107,0,0.058252427184466,0.902912621359223,"90.4516571224752","69.912999042632","1.29377452492517","neutral"

My husband has a full time salaried position with the county government that pays slightly less than $22K a year, and the SSI three of our four children receive for being autistic means I can stay home and be there for them. I tried working, when there were more jobs, but we had severe discipline and anxiety problems. Our girls seem to fall apart right now when I’m not home. So I stay home. We own a trailer, and rent a lot in a trailer park. In the past year, people have been moving out because they can’t even afford mortgages on cheap mobile homes. In the summer, if you looked out the window, you would see a procession of guys pushing lawn mowers down the streets. Those were residents who were looking for odd jobs because they had hit rock bottom, and mowing lawns was preferable to outright begging. They never seemed to get work, maybe because nobody could afford to hire a lawn mower.I was raised upper middle class, sent to private schools, went to a private undergraduate institution (graduated cum laude), did my master’s work at the University of Oxford, and after working in an industry that imploded (mortgages) wound up as… a professional telemarketer. My husband was told, when doing his paralegal studies degree, that the average paralegal starts at $35K to $40K and can make up to twice that amount. Statistics showed this to be true. His college did also have a near-100% placement rate… but when he graduated, few law firms were hiring. He got hired by the county department of probation at a salary usually associated with entry level receptionists. He was one of the lucky ones.There are homeless children in the school our daughters attend. And yet we are told, “Hard work pays off. If you are not successful, you have only yourselves to blame.” And the children who have no home? No food aside from what they get in the school cafeteria? What are they being told?WE ARE THE 99%.

Our home is 38 years old, falling apart, and has mold.  We can’t afford to get rid of the mold, fix our crumbling roof, outdated electrical system, or dry rotted siding.  Our patio door has been boarded up since last year when someone shattered it breaking into our home.  We didn’t/don’t have homeowners’ insurance or money to replace it.  And I work full-time!  My mother receives Social Security (she’s a senior), but it’s not enough.  Because of her age, my mother also receives Medicaid, but they subtract the costs from her Social Security payment!  WTF?!  It was already reduced because she got it before she turned 65.  She really had no choice because she couldn’t find a decent job.  My boyfriend is ex-military, but was denied VA Benefits because he didn’t go to war.  He’s got an enlarged heart, hypertension, and needs a kidney transplant.  S.S. and Medicaid are denying his claim.  Meanwhile politicians receive pensions and heathcare for LIFE! Even after they exit office! What little my mother gets from Social Security does help, but she needs a steady full-time job.  She hasn’t had one in 3 years.  Not that she should be working at all.  My mother is 67 years old!  When she should be enjoying her “golden years” and grandkids, she’s still on the grind like everyone else looking for work.  I read on CNN Money yesterday where some writer said the colleges and universities are to blame because everyone keeps posting about their student loan debt.  Well, that is, when they bother to cover our “occupation” on the news at all.  But the writer totally missed the point.  Colleges didn’t gamble our retirement savings away playing the terrible and unpredictable odds of the stock market!  They didn’t cause the housing crisis!  They didn’t hand over our taxes to bailout the banks, auto industry, AIG, and Wall Street!  They haven’t kept us in 2 wars with no end in sight, and no job prospects for troops when they return home!  CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, AND WALL STREET did.  Some say this is our fault and we shouldn’t be asking for “handouts”.  But since when are jobs, affordable education, the ability to start a family, a clean environment, medical care, food and shelter “handouts”??? The American Dream has become The American Horror Story.  Everyday many of the 99% live in fear.  I fear that I will be arrested, put in jail, and lose my job for the outstanding traffic tickets and suspended license I can’t afford to pay.  I fear the IRS, or some other corporation or bank that ALREADY RECEIVED OUR TAXPAYER MONEY in the form of bailouts will garnish my check for an outstanding bill I can’t afford.  I fear what’s happening to me and my mother’s health because of the mold growing in our home.  I fear that we could have a fire, flood, or tree damage and lose what we have left because we can’t afford homeowner’s insurance (tall pine trees are the norm here).  I fear that someone will break into our home again (for the 3RD TIME) and cause more damage we can’t afford to fix.  I fear that one day I will get laid off from my job because the furloughs and rising costs of running the university where I work won’t be enough to keep me employed.  I look at my 11 y.o. son and recognize that sparkle in his eyes.  I used to have that when I was his age.  I believed (and was told) that if you work hard you can do anything, be anything, accomplish anything.  How can I look him in the eyes and say that to him when I don’t believe it myself???  I breaks my heart.  Thats what the 1% has taken from me.  From him.  From my mother.  From all of us.  They say the most dangerous (wo)man is one that has nothing to lose.  Clearly the 1% doesn’t realize this, or worse yet, they don’t care.  Well we (the 99%) can show them better than we can tell them!!  WE’RE DONE!!!","2011-10-20",1,0.539518900343643,0.144329896907216,0.264604810996564,0.0515463917525773,"182.771051357577","260.948750049061","0.700409759859798","negative"

This is all while kids with trust funds are getting handouts because their parents and family members are rich and famous alums. I went to a private school because it was the only school in the country with the program I needed. I was assured that “the only good debt is college debt.” I am already almost $100k in the hole.

I still don’t have my license because I don’t have a job and can’t afford car insurance.I’ve had two jobs in that time, neither one of which lasted more than 3 months before I was laid off, and both of which my step-father got for me, and drove me to. (No public transportation where I lived.)My boyfriend and I are both high school dropouts. (Yes, our fault, I know.) My boyfriend works out of town 5, sometimes 6 days a week, and the local college doesn’t offer GED programs on the weekends. We can’t afford the more expensive online high school diplomas. Because of that, there is no hope for either of us to get a GED right now. We aren’t lazy. We want to go to college, but are afraid that it would just put us in debt.I sit at home and pass the time by doing any volunteer work I can do online in an attempt to keep myself busy and to keep my depression at bay. I had hoped that this would look good for when I try to get a job, also, but it’s impossible to throw that in there when everywhere requires a GED or higher and nowhere will call me back.My boyfriend also had his salary cut a few months ago, around the same time our car broke down. He is lucky - he works with his uncle, so he has a ride to work. But we don’t have the money to pay for a reliable vehicle, and we definitely don’t have the money to throw away on a vehicle that will only last us a month. So we’re waiting.

My boyfriend is forced to do work at his job that he isn’t even paid for, but he can’t complain for fear of losing his job - even though we really need that extra money. But we’re lucky. We can still afford food and a roof over our heads. We just have nothing left at the end of the month to get ahead. We’re only falling farther and farther behind. We’re only 22. We aren’t criminals. We aren’t greedy. We donate when we can, and we’re always lending a helping hand to people in need. All we did wrong was drop out of high school, and we want so badly to correct that but we can’t.

I was laid off. Insurance was canceled and access to Doctors stopped.Treatment never completed. No followup medically done.3 Months later Company sold to foreign company.Seems clear that although my performance evaluations and client approval ratings were through the roof, the cost factor of my illness was a part of the issue.Looked more profitable for buyout.Execs who got rich off my sweat, then laid me off made millions.Foreign company laid off 60% of local employees who built company.I got unemployment for 99 weeks while actively seeking work.I have applied to over 350 jobs.

I have a Bachelors of Science in Nursing and, luckily, a job.  I graduated HS salutatorian of my class with a 4.1 GPS. Despite working hard, I could not qualify for college scholarships due to my non-citizen status (I am Brazilian). My generous mother helped me afford my “moderately priced” college tuition (which I had to pay “out-of-state” although I lived “in-state”) while I worked part time @ minimum-wage as an after school counselor. Thankfully, I was able to graduate debt free, and with good grades.Once employed, I worked my @ss off for a year and saved to buy the small home I now “own” (along with my bank). I continue to work my @ss off and feel privileged to have benefits. My furniture is mostly hand-me-downs, my car previously-owned, and my bills (mostly) paid on time. Because of budgeting at work, I am a nurse, janitor, secretary, scrub tech, and my own aid. Every other Friday, I see a bulk of my paycheck withdrawn for taxes, social security, and my insurance. The same insurance that denied the medical procedure I NEED labeling it as “cosmetic”. My “guilty-pleasure”… the 3 dogs I adopted because my big heart cannot bear to think where they would be if I didn’t. They are the loves of my life!My live-in boyfriend (whom I have dated for 8+ years) can’t find a job despite countless hours searching, applications, with almost no call-backs or interviews. He works part-time for his father so he can at least contribute to our bills. I work nights, we barely see each other, and both have put a tremendous amount of pressure on our relationship. I had an abortion at age 19 because I thought that without a college degree, and a child to raise, I’d be worse off today. Now I am not so sure.I am, for the first time in my life, in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making ends meet and constantly afraid one day I will lose everything I’ve worked so hard for. I don’t go on vacations, I am not “living the dream”, or splurging on things I don’t need. I am tired, stressed, anxious, frustrated, uncertain of my future, over-worked, and under-paid. As a result my health is declining and I’ve gained a significant amount of weight. Instead of hitting the gym, I currently spend my time looking for another part-time job. Despite it all, I still consider myself LUCKY I’m not worse off.I don’t want a pretentious life full of glitz and glamour. I just want what EVERYONE DESERVES, to be happy, healthy, and make a significant positive difference in the world. I desperately would like to further my education but am starting to wonder, if it’s even worth it… We want a wedding but can’t afford it… We want kids, but REFUSE to bring them into a world where your job is not YOUR job, your paycheck is not YOUR paycheck, your home is not YOUR home….

I’m 28. I graduated in December 2009 with a Bachelors in Graphic Design from a top school. I am the only one of my siblings who completed college. Luckily for me, I graduated with zero debt because my childless aunt, who is a doctor, paid for my education. I have been unemployed for a year and a half after working the graveyard shift in a warehouse for nine months at $10 an hour until the warehouse shutdown and moved out of state. I have been working since I was a teenager and this is the longest I’ve been unemployed in my life.I live with my mother, my brother and my sister. None of us have jobs. My sister is 31, my brother is 26 and my mother is in her 60’s. My mother was a retired civil engineer but she can’t even get a job at Walmart because she is overqualified and has been out of work way too long. We are living off my father’s life insurance money from six years ago that is quickly running out. We have less than 50K left in the bank and we use at least 30K a year for living expenses. We could very well be homeless in the next year.I have sent out hundreds of resumes without responses. I have long “lowered my standards” and applied to any job. However, even janitor positions require at least a year of previous janitorial experience. The few job interviews I had in my field were nerve-wracking group job interviews where I was staring my competition of seven or eight people, young and old, in the face competing for one job position. In other professional job interviews, I was told that I was competing against people who “worked in the industry” who had decades of experience. I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting a job. There is a huge demand for my design work, yet no one wants to actually pay for my services. I end up literally FREE-lancing my design work.All of the few and far between low-paying jobs in my area are temp positions. NO ONE spoke a word of English at the last job I worked in a produce warehouse working for $8 an hour 40+ hours a week before I was laid off.I have a medical bill for over a thousand dollars from when I was badly beaten randomly on the path in my town earlier this year by a drunk stranger and woke up in the hospital getting stitches in my face.

This isn’t counting all the times we’ve “couch surfed” at the homes of friends and family. My father committed suicide when I was 9, though he never was involved in my life before that, so my mother and little sister are all I have. All three of us are in college. Mom is working towards a graduate degree at age 57, despite no real job opportunities looming on the horizon after she finished, and it is taking us all a long time due to poverty-induced problems (no car, no electricity, no home, ect) or illness. I’ve been in and out of college for 6 years now, and if I’m lucky I might finish my BA in the next two. We only survive because of S8 and EBT. Without it we would be homeless and hungry. I’ve been actively searching for part-time work for 2 1/2 years now, but our area has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country (15.2%), and I haven’t gotten a call back since 2009.

I didn’t have health insurance, and I couldn’t make ends meet)* I was told that getting a degree, ANY degree, would be my ticket to the American Dream. My first job was in management, where I earned less than $10 per hour and was the victim of MASSIVE time fraud. I quit after three months because my roommate moved out and I couldn’t afford the $500 per month rent on my own. I moved back in with my parents and worked at a variety of jobs, but the most I seemed to be able to make was $1,200 per month AFTER taxes, and I was in charge of an entire DEPARTMENT. I was paying my bills but couldn’t afford to move out of my parents’s house. So…Secondary Teaching Certificate, 4/2007 - Debt Incurred = $5,500 for tuition and fees and supplies for six hours of graduate credit, plus application and testing fees and all sorts of other headaches, including FIVE sets of fingerprints for background checks* My profession is under constant attack. I make $2,000 per month after taxes and have NO job security (despite what most people believe). I think I have an ulcer, but have no time to get it checked out because I teach almost 200 students per day and the grading and paperwork is drowning me. I’m also the Debate Coach, and we compete 2-3 weekends PER MONTH during the season (which is just starting). Competitions are Friday night, usually until midnight, and all day Saturday. My “stipend” for this “extra duty” comes out to less than $100 per month after taxes.*I am the sole wage earner in my household; my husband is disabled in multiple areas. Because he only was able to work 2-3 months in his whole life, his disability “benefit” is only $419 per month with ZERO chance of increase (trust me; investigating that was my “second job” for several months). After we make his car payment (a holdover from happier times), there’s only $44.19 left. And we’re so upside-down on the car that even selling it won’t help - there’s no way we’d get enough to pay off the loan, and then we wouldn’t have the car. We’re hoping Vocational Rehabilitation will help pay for him to go to cooking school (he has a Bachelor’s Degree in English that his parents paid for, but there are no jobs for English majors that don’t involve “Do you want fries with that?” and then we lose what little we get from disability and he loses his Medicare) because we really can’t afford for him to be on disability anymore. I really don’t think he’s physically or emotionally capable of holding down a job, but we have no choice. Our state superintendent and governor have plans to completely dismantle public K-12 education in this state, and most people (based on polls and such) seem to think this is a wonderful idea, because then they could repeal the state income tax (common education is 51% of the state’s budget, apparently), so I will be out of a job in the not-too-distant future anyway (and I don’t really want to stay - I love my students, but I can’t handle the 14-hour days of teaching and grading anymore, and I’m sick of the bureaucracy and jumping-through-hoops and getting yelled at for doing my job).I’m SCARED, I’m STRESSED, and I’M DONE!!!!I am the 99%. occupywallst.orgNO MORE SILENCE!!!!!!!","2011-10-18",4,0.218884120171674,0.283261802575107,0,0.497854077253219,"119.376396052683","172.728023412291","0.691123499790989","negative"

My mother comes from a long line of hard-working, blue-collar European immigrants who also came to America in search of a better life. It was through the hard work and sacrifices of both of my parents (and their parents, and so on) that I was able to attend excellent private schools my entire life. I graduated from a top University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Film and no debt. Staring down the barrel of my seemingly silly diploma, I feel like I have no reason to complain. But facing the distinct possibility that I may never build upon the dreams and aspirations of my parents and pass them onto children of my own scares me to my core. I cannot even fathom the difficulties in raising a child in our current world. Everyone around me who has a family struggles to stretch what little income they have and often fails to cover the bare minimum. So I’m waiting…but for how long?I have never wanted an ostentatious life. I just want to be happy. I want my life to have a purpose, and I want to contribute the world in a meaningful way. I am overqualified and underworked. I’ve undoubtedly benefitted from my parent’s generosity, but also have been working and paying income taxes and social security since the age of 10. I look good on paper. I’m a great interview. I think outside the box, but I understand why the box is there in the first place (even if I don’t agree with it). I’m an artist with an entrepreneurial spirit. I could be doing so much more, if I was only given the chance. As a multi-cultural, college-educated, world-traveled female, I occupy a liminal space that could be of great benefit to our nation as it sags under the weight of inflexibility and dread.

Tangled in a web of building codes and permissions, financial analyses, and bills I consider myself privileged in that I can still rely on my parents. They are working way past their retirement age to bridge the gap left by the financial crisis created by Wall Street.  My parents are even more burdened with debt than I am. The option of selling their real estate in this market is moot.  They live paycheck to paycheck. I aid them in what they cannot. I continue my renovations with only my own two hands.

Okay, I’m an aide making district minimum. Before they’ll let me teach, I have to prove I know how to do that. According to the government, I can only do that by going into even more debt by taking classes rather than by experience in actual schools. I won’t let that stop me. Even if I don’t make enough to afford it. And I already work 10 hour days.My school doesn’t have a librarian. We couldn’t afford to pay her. She had to move in with her son. Our students can’t check out books at an age (10, 11, 12) when literacy is so important. At least we have copy paper. We’re better off than some schools. We have computers that are more than ten years old. At least we have computers. We had to apply for a grant to offer after school care for working parents and we can only include a select few that really need it. Those that manage to squeeze by aren’t included. There’s no help for those that make something but not enough.I was raised by a single mother. She worked from the time I was 3 to this day. We lived paycheck to paycheck but she made sure I never knew how little we had. We barely managed to squeeze by. Thanks to affordable housing, she has something to pass down to me.

I have a Ph.D. I’ve never made more than $38,000 a year. I haven’t worked full-time in two 1/2 years. I have paid $438/month on a student loan for the past 17 years (13 more to go). I can’t afford health insurance. My unemployment runs out soon.Since being laid off, I’ve duct-taped severe wounds that needed stitches and slaughtered chickens at home to lower my food bills. A healthy society would use my talents and education (which I and once-generous grantors paid for) to build a stronger, more productive country. Today’s America treats me like dirt.There are no jobs within hundreds of miles of my house that make good use of my training or skills. If somebody did want to hire me - an overqualified older worker – as minimum-wage stockclerk or secretarial temp, the pay wouldn’t cover my bills and student loan debt.I don’t want a bailout. I don’t want tax cuts. People rant at me all the time: “we need less government.” I don’t want that. I want my government back.The corrupt, flagrantly irresponsible, non-financial geniuses who destroyed our economy got bailouts and bonuses. The government fails to hold mortgage lenders and investment bank shareholders liable for the losses they caused. But it requires me to pay back my loans – some at excessive interest rates.A Sallie-Mae-lobbied law, for example, has banned me from refinancing my 30-year, $50,000, 8-percent student loan for the past 17 years. Mortgage rates have been much lower the entire time.  A refi – say from 8 to 6 percent — would have saved me $24,000 in interest payments. (I’ll pay a total of about $82,000). (Who gets this money? Sallie Mae).If I miss a monthly GSL payment, the law lets lenders add the unpaid interest to the principal. Then they charge interest on the ever-higher total amount. The law bans me from bankrupting out of the loan. If I can’t find enough work that pays well enough once unemployment runs out in January, I’ll pay on this loan ‘til I die.The speculating bankers and conman lenders cost me a 5-year investment of tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of labor fixing up my home. When I married in ’08 and moved out, the crash cost me the $20,000 I’d invested in lost equity. I can’t get rid of the $45/month mortgage insurance payment now – my equity keeps falling. I had to rent the house to survive. And then I didn’t qualify for the federal energy-efficiency tax deduction given to homeowners – because it wasn’t offered to landlords. Meanwhile, in America, power and wealth become ever more concentrated at the top. Wealth is more equally distributed in Guyana, Nicaragua, and Venezuela than it is here.

I was denied grants because I dropped out of high school at 16 to get a job & help to support my family. The only way I could afford college was to take out student loans. After two years at a subpar school, my degree program was dropped completely. 75% of my credits became worthless. At the same time, my sister had a mental breakdown & was hospitalized. I dropped out and moved back home to help my mom take care of her & pay the medical bills. At that time, I was working in a private home, caring for an elderly woman for $100 a week, and living with my girlfriend and four other roommates in a 3br trailer. I currently live with my family in a trailer from the 70s that is falling apart, I am unemployed, and we can barely keep food on the table. I have not had health insurance since I turned 18 and was cut off from Medicaid, which is the ONLY insurance I ever knew. I have not been to a doctor or dentist in over four years. I am young, intelligent, capable, and willing to work, but, despite the fact that I apply to 30+ jobs every single day, I am still unemployed! It has been over 6 months since I left school, and my loans are due, but I have no way to pay them. I am $7k in debt, and see no near solution. I do not blame the government for my problems, but I AM part of the 99% and I WANT CHANGE!I ONLY WANT A CHANCE!occupywallst.org","2011-10-16",4,0.346774193548387,0,0,0.653225806451613,"73.5632725254117","96.3099023156067","0.763818369209279","negative"

I earned my credential and applied to over 100 jobs my first year out of college. I got rejected by all of them. I was able to find part time work at a local school. I’m lucky to even be working.

I often take work home with me on weekends too.And yet with all this hard work and a family with two bread-winners we are still far from rich, and after seeing what happened to my friend, don’t think I will ever find a company that will reward my loyalty. My father who used to own his own business lost his business to competition from a big conglomerate on corporate welfare. When did this become acceptable? Why has it taken us so long to fight back?My tax dollars pay for corporate loop holes and Government subsidies.

I’ve had enough!The American people are too big to fail.I want to live the American Dream. People in the pro-corporate media want to marginalize these people who are finally taking part in their Democracy and using public space and public goods (like the internet) to have their voices heard. We don’t have lobbyists. This movement is all we have when our Democracy is up for sale to the highest bidder. I don’t hate the 1 percenters like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates who lived out the American dream in *gasp* the so-called ‘liberal-socialist dystopia’ known as the San Francisco-Bay Area’s Silicon Valley. They have created something that many people use and deserve to be rich. But both of them also understood the idea behind the underlying social contract we are all born into by virtue of being American. We all helped pay for their education. We all helped pay to keep them safe and secure. We all paid for the roads that helped them get to and from work and school, and all paid to make sure their food was safe and not poisonous and that their water was pure and clean. And it is America’s (we the people’s)  investment in ‘human’ capital that helped make them what they both became. For those who are greedy and claim to have gotten to the top without any help, try living in the Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Try making it there and then we can talk about ‘making it all on your own.’ I stand in solidarity with the unemployed, the poor, the educated, the uneducated, the young and old.

I have just received my paralegal certificate, but am having a bit of a hard time finding a job here in Austin, Texas. The job market down here seems to have evaporated rather quickly, since we have a $27 billion+ budget shortfall in  this state, and a lot of of the jobs here in the capital are government jobs that are on the chopping block.But, whatever you do, don’t tell that to my Governor, Rick Perry. He’s too busy perpetually running for office to give two craps about me. He is currently running for President of the United States of America, less than 1 year after getting re-elected to his fourth consecutive term as Governor. During this legislative session, there was much debate over releasing money from a state rainy-day fund to pay for state workers’ jobs. Perry said that he would veto any measure that involved releasing the said fund that came his way, because he is afraid the truth behind his “job creation” record will come to a head. As a result, 49,000+ teachers, among thousands of other state workers, here have lost their jobs.But, at least under Gov. Perry’s watch, there are plenty of McDonald’s and Wal-Mart jobs, as long as you don’t mind living with your parents, and as long as they don’t mind you living with them.I have looked at paralegal job postings on Craigslist every day, and just about all of them have said something along the lines of “$9-13/hour with 3-5 years experience”. Seriously?! Get real, employers! The saying “you have to take what you can get” should work both ways. If I can’t negotiate my salary upwards, you can;t demand I have 3-5 years experience to go with that salary. If you go to a car dealership and say that because “we’re in a recession”, you should be able to buy a brand new Mercedes-Benz for the price of a used KIA, you’re just going to be laughed off the lot.i am 24 years old, I have Asperger’s Syndrome, and although I am physically healthy, I have to be careful for later as diabetes and high blood-pressure run in my family.One day, a few months ago, as I was riding home on the bus from my internship at a law firm downtown, the bus driver told me that his friend, another paralegal, made less money than he did. WTF?! Paralegals make less money than bus drivers?! The reason for this, according to the bus driver, was because a lot of the duties the paralegal used to do can now be done automatically by by computer.

I still live paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to put anything in savings. Since December I’ve been in a major depression and doing everything I can to keep working through it. I should request a leave of absence so I can get more intensive treatment and get better, but I can’t afford to pay the costs to keep rent, my car, my minimum payments and health insurance if I was out of work. There’s also the fear that there wouldn’t be a job to return to. My employer demands devotion and keeps piling the work on the shoulders of the salaried employees (me) that they can work for 50+ hours a week without paying overtime.  I’m cutting food and gas costs to pay for my medication and therapy co-pays.  It’s still not enough and I have to rely on credit for daily living expenses.I have friends that are lucky if they can pick up 25 hrs/week at a minimum wage job, despite education and 10+ years of work experience. They have no health insurance and they’re going without treatments that they need. I do what I can to help them with the little things, but it causes me even more pain and distress to know that I can’t do more.  This leaves me feeling desperate and guilty for complaining about what a hard time I’m having.  At 31, I’m lost and I don’t know what else I can do. Suicide isn’t even an option…it will just turn my debt over to my family and cause more distress for everyone I love.

At our graduation, one professor remarked that we’d be spending the rest of our lives building strip malls. Then the economy collapsed and I did what I was told… putting on a suit and tie every morning and making job searching a full time job. Six months and one interview later, I had produced nothing of value to anyone and was still living off mom and her soul killing job. I was then 35 years old and had a world of work experience. I knew the only thing to do was walk away from the game.I vowed I would do what I love even if it meant starving and doing it for free, so I did just that for three years. I’ve since worked on some of the most innovative treehouses in the world, I’ve designed and built in Haiti (You want to see the real results of our wonderful foreign and economic policies?) I’ve built community gardens, geodesic structures, and I’m engineering water catchment systems, hanging gardens and solar updraft power plants so that we can get free of this system as a whole culture.For the first time in my life I’m using my real gifts even though it’s meant living in vans and tents and on couches often after 14 hour build days. I’m 3 months behind on rent now, and thank god I have my health and youth. And for those of you with student loans, they HAVE to offer this to you if you ask, but they WON’T tell you if you don’t: call your loan officers and ask about Income Based Repayment.Oh… and I’ve also been learning about alternative economic systems.

Have a look at City Repair as a successful model for taking back our cities. Get involved, read, build, plant and walk away from their dirty money. Forget the Republibots and the Decepticrats, that game is bought and paid for. We won’t be free until we’re doing food forestry in the cities and legal tender laws have been abolished.I’m not armed, but I am dangerous. Watch out.  I am the 99%.

By the time I was 17 I was in college and working full time. At 18 I got my nursing license. After I was married and had my first child at 19 I went back to college and worked full time 11-7 so my husband could work during the day. I also worked part time cashiering at a convenience store. Right before Christmas of 2008 my husband was wrongfully terminated for having to take a few days off work after I had a miscarriage. They legally had to give him his position back but not until we threatened to get a lawyer. This was a company known only in our house as “Evilmart”, because they then told him that they made a mistake and he would not be receiving a pay check. My pay didn’t even cover all of our bills. We couldn’t give our son a Christmas that year. One of our friends played Santa and gave our son what we couldn’t. We’re very lucky to have the friends we do. I became disabled after I had our second child because of conditions I was born with. Later that year my husband was fired again, but this time, for good. 4 months later in January of 2010my 2 and 1/2 year old son had his leg viciously broken by my sister’s,now, ex-boyfriend. When I had a mental break down and had to drop the classes I was in, my college wouldn’t waive the tuition fees and I can’t go back until I pay them. I was 3 classes away from my Associates Degree in Psychology. I now have $26,000 in defaulted student loans and no way to pay them back or finish college. My husband has been unemployed for the last 2 years because he couldn’t find a job and exhausted all his unemployment benefits.

My husband has fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. His pay JUST covers the expenses for a family of 3.I just graduated college in May. I earned a 4.0 GPA, went to an ABA-Approved paralegal program, and did a semester-long internship with the county. However, now I cannot find a job. “Entry-level” jobs are going to people with 5+ years of experience. (WHAT??) I have even applied to be a file clerk at multiple firms. They told me that they have ATTORNEYS applying for the same positions. How can I compete with that? I am now considering going back to retail- back to minimum wage. It is better than NO wage. I would go back to school, but I have drained my savings in order to get THIS degree. Right now, spending more on school would mean loans and that seems silly, given I have had no return on my initial investment. I’d like to be able to tell my 11 year old that college is the best way to secure a bright future for herself. I thought that by going back to school I would be a good role model for her. Now, I’m not so sure. This may have taught her that college is a waste of money.Thank God my husband still has a job and that it provides health insurance! Without that we would be homeless right now. So it is deeply offensive when our politicians hold military pay hostage as a bargaining chip to keep tax cuts for the rich. (Oh, I’m sorry, “Job Creators”) (Wait…then where is MY job?)  The last time they did that, my husband was in Libya. He was worried that we might not get paid, might get evicted, all while he fought in yet one more war. We love our country. We WANT to believe in its leaders. But they have to inspire trust. Inspire faith. Right now they do not.·         We are the 99% and we demand leaders who are not puppets for corporations.·         We demand politicians who are not so far to the right OR left that they can compromise and work together to find solutions to our country’s problems.·         We demand job creation, investment in public education, and health insurance reform.·         We want hope. We want to be able to support our families.  The American Dream is not to become rich. It is to see the fruit of your labors, whatever they may be. It is to EARN your rewards. But Corporate America has taken the rewards away. All that is left is work and desperation. (Or no work, and even more desperation) A home, health insurance, providing for your children, giving them a future…those things SHOULD be attainable.  But unions are gone or ineffective. Politicians are corrupt. The Supreme Court values the speech of corporations over those of the people.  Jobs are taken overseas.  “These are the times that try men’s souls.” Thomas Paine said that.  He also said, “If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace.”                  So if MY labors must go unrewarded, so be it. But now, let us come together to find a solution. Let us make the country better for our children. I want to tell my child, “Go to college. Better yourself. Provide for YOUR family. Serve your country in whatever way you can.” We have to work together to keep the American Dream alive. occupywallstreet.org ","2011-10-11",3,0.078125,0.125,0.463541666666667,0.333333333333333,"146.095267309398","174.114317773411","0.839076700742802","negative"

It is her, my sister, and myself under one roof. She does anything she can to please us and make us happy. All she wants is us to content with our lives. But its been hard for her. And when its hard for her, its hard for me.She has been unemployed not for quite a few years ever since the factory she worked at so conveniently moved out of state. She’s been living off unemployment since then while job hunting. Still no job offers and those unemployment benefits cut off January 1st, 2012. Then she’ll be living off of the money she gets monthly thats my sisters and I. We may live in section 8, but its a 3 bedroom apartment and its pretty fucking pricey. She’s gone to speak to them so many times and they just won’t lower it. She pays phone bills (which is a necessity, we dont have a house phone because this way we could all just contact each other at any time), light, credit cards, and so much more shit thats shes in her ass with the amount of payments she has to make. Not to mention my sister should be going to college this spring. My mom’s paying for SATs and applications, and all sorts of educational things. And next year, the process will come again, but for me.The worst part? Everyday she mentions her strife. And then I just sit there in silence. Not knowing what to say. I don’t know how to comfort nor help her, I have no income and no matter how much research I have on the matter, I wont know how it feels until I’m living the struggle. But then she says, as if to reassure me, “But its okay, I know I’m going to figure this out”. And she goes on with a plan of how, while I know shes really just saying it to reassure herself. She wants to be a part of occupywallst but I don’t let her go out to those streets because of the arrests and such that take place.I used to be the person who would see a homeless person and never give them change. In my eyes, they put themselves in that position. It was nobodys fault but their own. But this movement opened my eyes. Nobody plans things like that. People dont say at the age of the 5 that they want to live on the street with no career, living a life of regrets and if only and what ifs. But it happens. Some people end up like that because they screwed themselves over, and some were screwed by the government and others. Now I drop change in their cups. Whether they go and spend it on liquor is their decision to make, and if they wash away their daily street savings on that, then its their fault. But, I did my part in helping them because one day, it could be me.I realized this yesterday when having a conversation with two of my friends on facebook. Everything that we are fighting for, is what Karl Marx spoke about in “The Communist Manifesto”. We are the Proletariat. Now I am not anti-capitalism nor am I pro-communism, but the government we have now is not working out. I mean, how long could a Capitalist society last? With this capitalist society, its no wonder that society has grown to be greedy and wicked from birth. And maybe its not to blame capitalism, but just our government. And soon enough, if the people don’t get what we want, I think we might turn to the Declaration of Independence and rise against the governments thats not currently working on helping out its people. But with our government, they would probably disregard that and kill us off by shooting down our efforts. Thats what they’re doing now with the arrests and the beatings of Wall Street Occupiers. And they speak of what they will do with and/or for us, but the clock is ticking and we can only wait so long. The longer we wait, the worse the economy gets, and the worse the rebellions will be. WE the people of the UNITED states of america should be working TOGETHER with the government. “United we stand, divided we fall”, remember that? But people who are doing fine, they dont care. Since they’re doing well, they wont dare help us. When in reality, the pain of one fellow american should cause pain in us all. And the fact that this is the majority of Americans who are suffering so much and still receiving little support from those who don’t relate is just sad. At any minute, anybody could fall into the 99%, and so instead of having such a division and inequality that separates us all into categories of such percentages, we should ALL as a whole and as a nation, look towards a 100%. We don’t have to all be working the same nor being paid the same, but, having the same chance at an equal life between everyone.

I fell behind 4 payments on my mortgage and am now facing foreclosure because I was unemployed for almost 6 months. I am scared. I owe back child support and am trying to decide every month if I should pay that or my car payment. My ex husband and I share our children 50/50 joint custody but I have to pay for health and dental insurance plus child support because, historically I have always made more money than him. He works for his family business. I have medical bills and prescriptions that I cannot afford, but also cannot afford not to take. I have chronic back pain and surgery was recommended, but the insurance plan I was on would not cover it. I cannot afford to pay for the surgery as it would cost as much as my car! I have 2 retirement accounts that I cannot touch because my ex husband won’t make a decision about whether to take his half with a penalty or make a retirement account in his name. Our divorce was supposed to be finalized in 2008.  I could have avoided the bankruptcy if I were able to just take my half of MY retirement that I worked for.  I would take the penalty to get out of this financial rut I am in. There is no help out there for me. My family members all are in a similar situation. For 6 years I worked 2 jobs and still could not get out of debt. I have 4 children and I cannot afford to send them to college. They do not participate in extracurricular activities because I cannot afford the uniforms, fees or equipment required. I cannot afford a land line phone in my home. I cannot afford to buy my children winter coats this year or shoes despite the fact that I now have a job. I am so very scared that something will happen to my job. I have spent my last 4 paychecks trying to catch up on my mortgage so I don’t lose my house and have fallen behind on my child support. I have to travel to another city to work and drive 40 miles/day. After my mortgage payment goes through this month, I will be left with about $200 in my checking and savings accounts combined. If I make my child support payment, that check will bounce and I will have nothing left. My children will go hungry, my gas and electric will get turned off, I will not be able to pay for my medications. I never thought that as a Registered Nurse I would ever find myself in this situation. It is depressing and frustrating and no one out there has any patience; they want their money NOW. I pay my taxes and am honest about my income. The poor get poorer, the middle class gets poorer and the rich continue to get richer with all kinds of loopholes in tax laws to help them stay that way. You can’t take it with you folks and you are raising spoiled brats who squander your riches and flaunt it with a blatant disregard for the homeless man they walk by and make nasty remarks about his status and hygiene. The world is dying so the rich can get richer. Society has become a throw-away place, where even people become the trash.  I work long hours and so much of my income gets taken away. I don’t think there will be social security for me. My children will only see it if I die while they are still minors. What a messed up world! It sickens me that those who have are able to close their eyes to the have-nots.Those in government have forgotten their role as a public servant who is supposed to be working for the people… who is supposed to be the voice of the people.  I think they should all be working for minimum wage and either have the crappy medical insurance the rest of us have if we are lucky enough to get it or have none at all like so many out there.  They should have to patch the holes in their clothing and darn their socks and have to have their shoes resoled or patched up with cardboard and duct tape.  They should be given a small, under $20K car to drive around and have to pay for their entertainment out of pocket like the rest of us do.

I was accepted into the #3 in the nation for my degree but decided that 60k in debt was better than $225,000 in debt. Because I made the more frugal choice it will harder for me to get a job in this field. I may not be able to attend much longer due to not having enough credit to get a loan this year. Now that I am 24 I do not qualify for loans given to first time college students.I now live with my mother, sister, her two children and her fiancé who also struggle to make ends meet.Our house is roach infested and mouse infested, but we can’t afford to move despite my mother working 60-80 hours a week and my sisters fiancé working 40 hours a week. We also can’t afford an exterminator either and our landlord won’t pay for one. For the first time in my life I know what hungry is. I use my credit card to buy milk, bread, cheese and lunchmeat for my family.Even when I had a high paying job I was denied health care because I was “overweight” with a pre-existing health condition. I now can no longer afford the gym membership I was using to get to a healthy weight, even though it’s only $10 a month.I do not qualify for food stamps because my household makes too much money yet we live check to check and some weeks can’t afford groceries.  I do not qualify for free health benefits because my “condition” is not serious enough despite the fact that I may have cancer. I can’t afford the $250 to get a biopsy done or the $200 for the lab results.  I cannot get jobs at fast food places or cleaning offices because I am “too qualified” (yay college) and I cannot get jobs working in my desired field because I have “too little experience.”My old boss calls me telling me that he can make me money in the adult entertainment industry if I ever wanted to be in front of the camera. The prospect of ever doing that job makes me cry at night. I shouldn’t have to give myself away for someone else’s viewing pleasure to live. For now I would rather 100% broke, than give up my integrity. It is only through the wisdom and guidance of my best friend and the hope of starting my own business with him that I have not taken my own life.I am the 99%. Occupywallstreet.org","2011-10-05",1,0.457894736842105,0.110526315789474,0,0.431578947368421,"143.322678587158","130.350528045307","1.09951743760748","neutral"

I worked two jobs through college to make ends meet and networked constantly my junior and senior year to try to find work after school. The Monday after graduating with my “useless” communications degree, I started as an intern in IT at a local college, making minimum wage  doing work that was not related to major, but work nonetheless. After a year of showing up on time and doing my job, they hired me full time and I was awarded affordable health benefits and a retirement fund. Two years and no raises later, they offered to pay for my MBA through their program at the business school. In 2010, I bought my first car, a new toyota corolla with money that I’d saved for almost 5 years. In 2011, I bought my first house on my own after living on my own since college in a shared apartment — a $72K, 1 bedroom condo with mortgage payments that were affordable, even with my low income. Shortly after, I finished my MBA and I was promoted into a higher paying job that allowed me to make larger payments against my debt while continuing to live a modest life.

They say they fired me, unemployment says I quit. Too late to fight for money. I have a 4 year old daughter who needs clothes, she grows fast. We lost our son a week before I supposed to have him. Doctors fault, no money to sue them. Because we have a child, we get state health insurance, and food stamps. It’s enough food for a month, if I don’t make big meal (ex. meat loaf, mashed potatoes, green beans, and whatever fruit we have) and if we don’t shop at name brand groceries. Health insurance pays for everything for my daughter. However, my husband is disabled, and cannot work. They will not pay for him to go see a neurologist, like he needs to, unless he gets a referral. But after he was told to go see one, he got into a car wreck, which made everything worse, so he went back to his doctor, to get some pain meds until he could get into see one. Since there is a car wreck on medical history, none of the neurologists here will see him. He has been denied disability, because he has not went to see one. We get $290 a month in cash assistants, our rent alone is $625. Cheapest we could find, that my daughter has her own room. Luckily we have family that helps us. They are running low on their funds. All of this is taking its mental, physical, and emotional damage on us. My daughter wears hand-me-down clothes, because we cannot afford to get her new clothes. They are all clothes that others have grown out of. And a lot of them do not look nice (stains, rips, falling apart). She needs shoes, and I hate making her wear used shoes. Winter is coming, and I will not let her wear hats worn by others for worries that she might get lice, and that will be another bill we will have to pay. We were given a truck, that is made for two, we have to make work with my daughters booster seat. It’s a manual, and since I am so short, my husband has to drive every where.

In the meantime, rents, gas prices & food costs have DOUBLED.I’m not a spendthrift, but I now owe about $16K in credit card debt. Why? I had to use the cards to pay for car repairs, building supplies for a home I no longer live in, and even to PAY MY INCOME TAXES!I recently had a diagnostic test. It cost $2K+. ALL OF THAT was applied to my $2,500 health insurance deductible.I borrowed money from my retirement fund so my brother and sister-in-law (and their 3 kids) wouldn’t lose their home over a property tax lien.I have NO SAVINGS…… and every time I start paying down my credit card debt, some emergency comes up, and because I have no savings, the credit card takes the hit.I have NO IDEA how I’m ever going to get ahead, or even tread water. I want to take care of my mother—she deserves it!—but I can barely take care of myself.

To sum it up:My parents started a fairly successful business in 1986. It thrived until just after 9/11, when all of their major clients moved out of state (I’m from NY and commute to NYC every day). By 2007, the year I graduated highschool, their business was defunct, and just a name.My father became permanently disabled in 2008. My mother found a new job making barely minimum wage in 2008.I started college in 2007, and I am still in today, 5 years later going for the same degree but at a different school. All the schools I went to were public. I will owe $25k when I graduate.My mother lost her job in August and has no health insurance and no income aside from occasional odd jobs from what was left of the business. She will have a hard time finding a job because she’s bad with computers, over 50, and over qualified on the business knowledge end, and has a bachelors.I got a job in June working in my field for just over minimum wage (after working elsewhere as an intern for free for a year, and a year of unemployment without being able to collect before, and 5 years of retail before that). I asked for a raise a few weeks ago and starting October I will have health insurance. I am VERY VERY LUCKY.We are at risk of losing our house that we have owned for 22 years and we are also at risk of losing our utilities, any month now.What kills me most is that my mother, who never ever cried, now cries daily. She’s extremely depressed and has bad insomnia. She feels hopeless.My dad tried to commit suicide in August. I received a suicide note via email - he thought I was asleep. I went to the rehab facility (he is learning how to walk again after a partial foot amputation) he is in and came just in time. He was planning on ODing on sleep meds.My parents know they are worth more dead than alive, because their life insurances allow for suicide. This terrifies me.WTF is wrong with this country that there are already 20 pages prior to this entry (at least) full of similar stories? Our constitution guarantees us the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness… Yet we have elected politicians on both sides who are only servants to the mega-rich who seek to remove our rights with our blind consent.

They have the education, the work ethic, and receive nothing but the bare minimum needed to survive for it, or less. They are indeed slaves to the noble class. You can’t “work your way up” if there is no way up.But there is. And it requires a lot more bravery and a lot more work and a lot more sacrifice. If everyone in the United States were to turn off their televisions and walk outside today and chant in unison and refuse to comply until a simple demand is met, they would either have to arrest everyone (impossible) or agree to change.We aren’t lazy hippies asking for handouts. We are tired and sore and beaten down and angry because we do exactly as we’re told, and receive nothing but the minimum amount of money for room and board for it, the very definition of a slave.Even people with higher powered jobs are losing any hope of retiring, their pensions taken, and any hope to receive what they are entitled to for THEIR HARD WORK is dwindling. The top 1% act with impunity and the 99% are punished for even the slightest infraction, sometimes just for fun or “because we can”.And most importantly, voting will not and does not work, because they own the politicians too. They fund the campaigns (most of the Dem/Rep campaign funds are from corporations), so you only ever see _their_ picks on TV, and then they buy them off on every important issue through lobbying, and they own the news, so you hear what they want you too. This isn’t even about getting a cut. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THAT MUCH POWER.Why do you think this hasn’t been covered by the news hardly at all, while a bullshit tea party protest of half the size with no spread to any other cities with a confused and irrational message was front page shit on just about every rag and news channel in the US?I’m hopeful because people are starting to realize that freedom is about freedom, not about working forever until you die with a vague promise that you might get to do some cool stuff eventually someday, when you pay off that student loan debt. Which is impossible.Oh. And you don’t own anything. The bank owns your house, your car, and all of your money in the bank. And now that they have person-hood, they can and will take it all when the coup is ready to go.And the world banks own them.In effect by transition, the world banks own you. And they are biding their time. And we are going to lose.The only time anything has ever changed, ever REALLY changed, it changed with a revolution, and sometimes it was bloody, but it has never, EVER, in the known history of human civilization, when people mostly consented to the establishment for now, biding their time, “busting their asses,” and then losing hope, and then dying that way.If you don’t act right this second, with God as your witness, justice on your side, and the willing spirit to die for a cause, who will? There has to be a beginning. There has to be a first. And we will be the first. And more are following. I don’t want a handout.

I stopped there, because I’d nearly exhausted the savings my parents had for me. And by 2008, I’d seen just how far a degree would get me: deep in debt. with little chance to every pay it back. A degree has become little more than pricey slips of paper, mocking us from their frames and envelopes. It took me three and half years to get that slip of paper. I’m one of the lucky ones, with no debt. But I also have no job. And no dreams, no this is slowly becoming a living nightmare. I had a minimum wage job, in another city, but I couldn’t support myself on $7.94 an hour. We had barely been getting by on two paychecks. Now I’m back in with mu parents, living off their generosity and my own meager savings. I’m applying to every job I can find out here. But so few places are actually hiring, and I am over-educated or under-experienced for nearly all of them. Or both.I played by the rules. I got good grades, went to college, and got a degree. I graduated in 2009, to no prospects. Nothing for me. Fast food joints don’t even call me back.I feel HOPELESS. I’m already depressed, untreated. I often find myself thinking of suicide, because I see no future for me. At all. The current reality depresses me more than anything else. There is nothing here for me to work towards. Nothing substantial for any of my friends either. My best friend is pregnant with their first child. At 7 months pregnant, she lost her job. She has since been rehired, but her insurance won’t pick back up for another 45 days. She’s due in 2 weeks. His family is well off, but they’re not rich. They help, but they can’t support them completely on the medical bills. So is that what we’re supposed to do now? Live off our parents? All of our parents are stuck as well. They’re torn between their own daily expenses and retirement funds, or supporting their grown children. Again. That is not a desicion they should be forced to make.We all played by the rules, and we were robbed blind. We sat back in blissful ignorance, and let them do this to us.We are the 99 percent. And we are sick of playing by these Greed-driven rules.","2011-09-28",4,0.253968253968254,0,0.0634920634920635,0.682539682539683,"96.8164078793271","174.807464953971","0.553845957921877","negative"
