I have quit my job that paid $67,000 a year with medical benefits due to the harrassment and threat of termination from my former supervisor due to his actions that costs the my former company thousands of dollars. Had I stayed, I would&#8217;ve been fired to save the company money. In either case, I have been denied unemployment which has resulted me in losing my apartment, car, and food. I have been denied access to all social saftey net programs because I have simply made the decision to quit rather than be fired. I have been without a job for 5 months now even though I am a highly skilled and hard working employee. My income tax of over $2500 has been seized to pay a school loan as well as child support. I have absolutely no income, due to the laws of this country that has made sure people like me have no access to public housing, medical care, or financial assistance. Although things for me have not been the greatest, I will not give up my rights as a human being to live, fight, and change things for the better for myself and people like me who are in my situation. My situation has strengthened my resolve in making sure that I can bring change to a country where change is severely needed. Our politicians need to listen to people without money, instead of people with an overabundance of it. We live in a country where there are empty homes, and homeless people; 24 hour grocery stores with men, women and children are starving to death; Universities that lack students yet millions of potential minds seeking an education; and a Federal Reserve that has countless funds of money yet millions of people in extreme and severe poverty. Where is my government that I paid for? Where is my government where I live? </p><p><strong>I am the 99%</strong></p><p><strong>OWS</strong></p>"

I lost my house. My wife left me a year ago, and cancelled my health insurance. My heart medications, insulin, and related supplies, not to mention ADD meds for my teenager, total $3500 a month. I don&#8217;t have $3500 to spend on meds, so I take a daily aspirin, and my kid is suffering in school. I&#8217;m waiting on the word that I have renal failure. A vial of insulin, that used to cost $15 a few years ago, now costs $80. Big pharma is gouging.<br/><br/> Now, I am facing eviction. My two children have never seen daddy without money. I am facing the grim fact that my life insurance policy and social security death benefits may provide my kids better financial security than I can. Like George Bailey, I am &#8220;worth more dead than alive.&#8221; I AM THE 99% <br/><br/> Jack<br/> Austin, Texas</p>"

I spent 4 years earning an associate degree in broadcasting (paid by the state) which did not get me a job in radio or TV. All the commercial TV stations in my city of Peoria have consolidated and seem to prefer Big Ten and Missouri Valley Athletic Conference grads. So I went 2 years earning by bachelor in business administration (paid by loans at a small private college) which I do not regret despite I can&#8217;t get a job as an administrative assistant due to &#8220;lack of experience&#8221;.

The IRS ripped me off on my 2011 taxes because my past employer (a call center for Verizon Telecom) must have fucked up my W-4.

I only have over-the-air television, eat beans &amp; rice every weekend, and do not need an expensive cell phone plan.

Employers should NOT hire people based on what college they attended and how are people supposed to get experience when companies won&#8217;t give them a chance?

With the way America is going, I&#8217;m not sure if I should become a momma someday; maybe instead raise unwanted dogs and cats. Yes I am jealous, insecure, bitchy, and pissed off because America thinks the poor are freeloaders wanting a handout or are a bunch of marijuana smoking hippies who live in their parent&#8217;s basement. That&#8217;s bullshit!

Our medical premiums continue to rise, doubling this past year, as our out of pocket expenses exponentially increase. This while the insurance company cries poor and posts quarter profits in the billions.  </span></p><p><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span""> </span>Still, I consider myself very lucky to have what I have. I am deeply concerned with what has transpired in this country for the last thirty years.  Our country was once known for its commitment of upward mobility and the “American Dream.” That commitment has been called into question as more of us struggle to make ends meet on whatever meager incomes we garner. Many of us are facing a crisis in confidence in many of our personal and professional lives. It has been said that great civilizations die from suicide rather than homicide. What we are experiencing is the hijacking of our political system from the corporate oligarchs that have swayed the judicial and legislative process for decades and have thus created a plutocracy where malfeasance is a common occurrence. Our current economy favors consumption over production; debt over saving; and self-indulgence over altruism. We Americans must insist on complete transparency, clarity and accessibility when it comes to conglomerates dictating policy and procedure. This goes for K-street as well as Wall Street. </span></p><p><span>The first step in overhauling the mores and values of Wall Street is setting up a system of checks and balances that would make the framers of our constitution proud.  All corporate entities that were on the receiving end of the bailouts should be subjected to unilateral fiscal and management audits conducted by reputable &amp; independent firms. These audits would not only track every transaction, settlement, and agreement; it would disseminate where money went and to whom. The mantra of &#8220;trust but verify&#8221; would echo the halls of all federated entities that have parlayed public monies. However, it would be naive to think that pure unadulterated accountability would ever happen in our current capitalistic paradigm where it’s every man for himself; capitalism without a conscience; and profits before the people. As Lord Action once stated: “Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.” </span></p><p><span>The next step towards reform is to bring government back to “We the People” &#8230; Not, We the Directorate. Both political parties have contorted and blended themselves into an amalgam of dishonesty and distrust that depend on the deep pockets of big business.  Lobbyists have taken away the principle of “one person one vote” and have rigged and exploited the political process to the detriment of the Middle Class. In 2009, over 13,700 registered lobbyists spent well over 3.5 billion dollars to control and manipulate the legislative process. That comes out to 6.5 million dollars for each legislative member. I have learned from OWS that change comes from within, that democracy is not a spectator sport and that we all need to get into the game.  I want to believe that we can create a fair and equatable capitalistic environment where everyone can be held to the same standard, no matter how much money they have.  We have always taught our children to work hard, be honest, have integrity and they will succeed in life.  That is no longer true.  The people who succeed lie, cheat, and steal at any cost to advance in life. That’s why I am proud to be part of the 99%. Occupywallstreet.org</span></p>"

Occupy has been a shock: I have met many professional equals whilst protesting, one of whom saw his office (KOW Den Haag) go from sixty to just six architects in one year: a slaughterhouse&#160;!</p><p>What my sign doesn&#8217;t say is: Whilst (not) finding work as a architect, I have also booked success as a teacher only to see all subsidies vanish as snow in sunshine and to land back out on the street for 2012. I have started my own business, it&#8217;s STILL starting due to the poor market. On the Dutch job-market you need a diploma for ANYTHING. I&#8217;m lucky not to have student-debt as I chalked up my years of evening school. Finding work anywhere else means back of line and back to school when just about EVERYBODY is firing NOT hiring.</p><p>For those of you red-necks out there still employed and still unable to fathom what going on: WAKE UP&#160;! It is SLANDEROUS to bawl GET A JOB at good and HONEST FOLK. Occupy has taught me there are plenty of haters out there but that most Occupiers are decent, hard-working (YES!) responsible citizens who care for each other and the world WE the 99% live in.</p><p>PS - My bank wrote to us recently, saying we had lost our &#8220;Preferred Banking&#8221; status because our income had slipped. The irony of it makes my laugh. I can think of SO many things preferable to a wunch of Bankers.</p>"

I found it in a newspaper with OWS as the cover story.</p><p>Who ever you are, I understand. We are hurting, too.</p><p>&#8220;Growing up, I constantly saw my mother overcome financially extreme adversities. My father abused my mother daily, but she was strong. She fought back. Once left with a house with no degree, no job, and myself at 8 years old. She became determined. In a span of 5 years, she in a job that was paying her 50,000 annually. </p><p>But over that time, she was constantly laid off. Multiple times of extreme stress, also on me. Dealing with an emotionally unavailable father, and financial problems burden a burden for me. </p><p> My mother lost plenty of times. So why, why if she gained alot as well, why doesn&#8217;t it seem enough? An honest, hardworking single mother with a house and two children. With financial burdens the banks seemed to make a mockery of. Why is it, that I cannot attend college because we can&#8217;t &#8220;afford&#8221; it? </p><p>  I&#8217;m not trying to make a pity party for myself, but we need to WAKE UP. The more I look around at the biggest problems we face, the easier it is to think of an obvious solution. But people seem willfully ignorant. And that bothers me. </p><p>    So much wrong doing in the world, while we settle for &#8220;just because.&#8221; What have people become? To put profit over the people? How addicting is money, and when is it enough for you?  When an innocent Iranian child dies? When an honest, hardworking, middle class resident who can&#8217;t keep up with the bills anymore? When? </p><p>   Because I have been looking for an answer. I am angry. Angry, AT US. For allowing this to be. Also upset because it hit me personally. I feel like the United States will completely disintegrate in my lifetime. </p><p>  But why? Ask yourselves, why. Why does this have to be? If we didn&#8217;t know about this corruption, it&#8217;s one thing. But when it&#8217;s in our faces, why do we still choose to accept it?</p><p>  As my mom is one missed check away from losing everything, I wonder why too. </p><p>                                                      99%</p>"

I volunteered to go to Iraq because the mainstream media led me to believe the US was building schools and hospitals. Shortly after entering the military despite my extensive construction experience I was trained how to shoot to kill and blow up buildings using minimal amounts of explosives. Around my 7th month in Iraq I realized we were not building schools and hospitals but instead enforcing laws the general public were uninformed of. It was at this time I began to internally side with the iraqi people and ever since have been afraid to speak up for the people around the world the USA oppresses for the sake of cheap oil and profits for banks and department stores for fear of being branded a traitor and terrorist. I have attempted suicide out of shame for being a part of a world war/domination in which there is no end in sight. Due to my injuries I am on VA disability and continue to live in fear that if I speak my mind on all of the horrible things the American government does to people all over the world the government will take my disability pay since I am unfit to work. My story is like many other&#8217;s but I do not seek pity instead I beg all of you to turn your attention not only to student loans and foreclosed homes in the US but to all of the sweat shops and slaves to corporate America all over the world. To the 40 year old women whom haven&#8217;t seen their children for a year or more because they work 80+ hours a week for $2 a day. To all the people all over the world that die because they don&#8217;t have health care. To the farming industry putting patents on the seeds of life. To the people&#8217;s RIGHT to Healthcare and Education being free for everyone. To corporations denying funding to free energy and cancer curing because &#8220;there&#8217;s no money in it&#8221;. To the fact that Millions marched in New York in protest of the wars when they first began and nothing happened because they didn&#8217;t see that protest is only the first step of action.To all of the gay Americans that take their own lives or are brutally beaten by their peers because the American Government refuses to agree with majority of America over gay rights sending a message that gay is wrong. To The Patriot Act being one of the most inhuman laws in free society.To the fact that anytime there is a study on casualties of war the count is always &#8220;this many American troops&#8221; and &#8220;this many iraqis&#8221; but never &#8220;This many human beings&#8221; which only divides us human beings as a whole. To the fact that our declaration of independence is from british oppression and tyranny even though we stand with Britain in these wars. To acknowledgement that we will never be able to separate the banks from government until we write a declaration of independence from inhuman banking and business practices and a  bill of rights guaranteeing free education and healthcare and a right to fair wage.</p><p>I fought for the US government in the name of freedom</p><p>Now I fight with the 99% for freedom</p><p>I am the 99%</p><p><span>                                              occupywallst.org</span></p>

As normal workers we just can&#8217;t afford vacation homes all over the world as the government would like us to, so we do not qualify as human enough to remain together.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This isn&#8217;t the first time the machine has done this to my family and my people under different guises. Over the last century they have tried to (and have succeeded with some family members) to gas us, freeze us to death, starve us to death, steal our land, take our country, put us in concentration camps on two continents, put us on forced reservations, and now this- forced homelessness to meet the needs of the paperwork.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My family and my people have been dehumanized by the machine over the years due to status, race, creed, and origins. I have watched as the machine has forced my neighbors into slavery in prisons because of nothing but the color of their skin.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Previously, the family members that survived have fled, hid, and lied to protect their lives. Now it&#8217;s my turn. I choose truth. I choose to turn around and stand up to the machine, knowing full well that whatever the court may be called, I am facing a death panel, the same one that has been trying to annihilate my family for a century at least.  Knowing that a killer cannot be reasoned with. Knowing that a machine with no soul will never be able to recognize humanity in a person with a soul and a pulse.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I followed all of its rules like a sheep, tried following its commands, when its paperwork was messed up I took the weight of it and suffered for it. When I could have worked to free myself I did not, because its rules told me I was not allowed to work. I fairly well shot myself in the foot to blindly obey it. And now when I am bleeding and asking for one line of bandage for the wounds I have sustained obeying it, it kicks me in the shin and throws my children to the wolves. I can imagine my people went into the gas chambers in much the same way, having hope that the machine would show a soul, hope that if they just obeyed that it would be kind, but all the obeying did was end their lives.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Am I crazy to face it, or am I fed up? It threatens my husband and my children. If it were just threatening me, maybe I would do the sane thing and run like my surviving ancestors before me. But the anger and protective instinct when a murderer tries to attack my family is too much. I cannot back down. If they do not cease to light the fire in their gas chambers, I will drag them down into the flames with me. This crushing of humanity must end.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I am the 99%</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Occupy Everywhere</p></p>"

Reading the stories of others. Relating to some, crying for others &amp; being thankful that, although I face my own struggles &amp; fight my own battle, it is not as burdensome as others.<br/><br/> I am 37 years old. I have spent the majority of my adult life disenchanted &amp; angry because my grandparents taught me that the &#8220;American Dream: was achievable. Yet, no matter how hard I&#8217;ve tried, I&#8217;ve been unable to achieve mine. As much as I miss my grandparents &amp; could truly use their wisdom in my life right now (not to mention their warm hugs, love &amp; family bond), I am glad that they did not live long enough to witness the destruction of the country &amp; ideals that they fought for. I know they would be heartbroken to learn that faith, loyalty &amp; heard work are no longer valued &amp; rewarded in America. <br/><br/> Last year, at a time in my life where it would seem all hope was lost, I chose to believe that my grandparents were right when they told me that I could do anything &amp; be anything, as long as I was willing to do the work to achieve my goals. So, I took a leap of faith &amp; I moved my family into a new apartment, despite having no job, &amp; I began the process of getting myself re-enrolled in cosmetology school. I chose to follow my passion &amp; my dream. I found a new job &amp; accepted a wage far below that which I am accustomed to, but found a way to make it work. I lived on a tight budget &amp; slowly began to climb back out of (some of) my debt. I started school &amp; began to have hope, once more, that I really could achieve everything I dreamed of.<br/><br/> But now the debt is mounting again. When you&#8217;re forced to live on a budget &amp; can&#8217;t afford to put money into savings, all it takes is one unexpected expense to push you back out into the deep in, struggling to tread water. So now I am back at square one, trying to find a way to move forward. I&#8217;m living paycheck to paycheck, supporting 2 teenage boys (one in college!) on an income I haven&#8217;t had to live off of since 2000! Earlier in the year we qualified for food stamps (a little relief), but now that my oldest is 18 they want to count his part time job as &#8220;household income&#8221; &amp; factor his $400 per month into our budget. Still waiting to hear back on that, but I have a feeling this will push us over the &#8220;poverty line&#8221; &amp; we&#8217;ll lose that little bit of assistance. I receive child support for my 15 year old, but the meager $346 per month ($250 court ordered + $96 to go towards the over $6000 in arrears from when he quit paying for 2 years) is hardly 1/2 the cost of raising a child. I have mounting medical expenses &amp; need a surgery that I can&#8217;t afford (despite having decent insurance). And recently my 15 year old&#8217;s depression took  turn for the worse, prompting me to seek out more &#8220;specialized&#8221; therapy, which (of course) is not covered by his insurance &amp; is costing me $115 per session, out of pocket.<br/><br/> Through all of this I am watching the company I work for slowly dissolve &amp; I fear it will eventually go under. When I accepted my position last December I became the 4th person in a department that really could have used 5 people. Today we are down to 2 people - me &amp; my former supervisor. She was demoted &amp; her pay severely cut&#8230; &#8220;restructuring&#8221;. She&#8217;ll be gone soon, just leaving me. They won&#8217;t re-hire. And the likelihood of receiving a raise in pay to compensate for the growing work load is extremely slim. I just hope the company holds on until I can finish school.<br/><br/> But again&#8230;. there are people worse off than me. I know this. I remind myself of this every single day. But how am I supposed to give my sons hope for their futures &amp; instill in them even a glimmer of the faith that my grandparents instilled in me when there are no longer examples to point to of men &amp; women who worked hard &amp; believed in themselves &amp; achieved their dreams&#8230; successfully? How am I supposed to convince my depressed 15 year old son that their is something worth fighting for &amp; that we really are some of the &#8220;lucky&#8221; ones?</p>"

All the medications I tried left me worse off than the disease itself. My neurologist and I have found one that works, but my insurance continues to refuse to pay for it. Due to this, I was left unmedicated for months. In that time, my disease progressed to the point where I can’t even hold the most basic of jobs. My neurologist is truly kind, and has been medicating me out of her pocket while we await what may be yet another denial from insurance. I can’t work, and don’t receive any benefits beyond unemployment, which only pays me 400$ a month. Meanwhile, I have additional debt to a college that I tried to attend last year, but had to drop to focus on finding elusive work. I attended a week of classes, and owe thousands for it. I am a bankrupt 20 year old who has worked since I was 15. I am a patient suffering from the judgement of men in suits. I am a young man who has seen his livelihood stolen, but not from disease.

I stayed strong for my mommy and daddy, as they had to be strong for me. My mommy was medically discharged from the Army so she used the GI Bill to get her nursing degree. Her only income was her monthly housing allowance. Once I was born mommy had to put school on hold. I was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit attached to a ventilator and numerous other machines. Mommy held my hand and sung with me. My daddy is a very special man. He left his job to go work for a company that offered better insurance. The drawback was the hours he would have to work to provide for us. We would hang out together at the hospital until he left for work and then he would come back up for bath time, and occasionally we even got sleep overs.  It was great!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My mommy and daddy don’t like handouts, but we preemies automatically receive Medicaid as a secondary insurance. Since daddy didn’t get his new job until after I was born no one knew who would be picking up the enormous bill. Mommy and daddy were told quiet often that it could be them. It began to eat at them. You could read it in their faces.  They struggled to spend all their time with me, but “time is money”. It took money to put gas in the car, food on the table, keep bills out of the red.

This is not what my mommy and daddy thought becoming a parent would be like, but they are lucky. Today they found out that Medicare has covered all my hospital expenses! Today we found out, that when utilized appropriately, government programs work. We are lucky Medicare wasn’t abolished before I was born or my parents would have their last memory of me be a hospital bill.

Our government is every part as responsible for this system break down. Our own Congress cannot reach an agreement on how much of a paycut to give themselves, but have no issue doling it out to the rest of the country. Our generation, and our children&#8217;s generation will fit the bill for this greed. Universities are also to blame. The amount of money that is poured into education never makes it to education or our educators. Instead the adminitration continues to let their accounts swell, while the teachers and staff have to face pay cuts, furlough days, and loss of benefits. The students suffer the most. How are we supposed to further our education and careers, when we aren&#8217;t even given a chance, just piles of debt that continue to accrue each month? I am tired of politicians and their pointless agendas, and I&#8217;m sick of these bureaucrats and fat cats who are willing to let everyone suffer, just so they have more money to put in offshore accounts.

I was a medical discharge for service-induced asthma. I returned to college as a VA Voc Rehab student. After a year of school, the college said I was overpaid and had to return $3K to remain a student (despite stellar grades). The VA refused to help with my court appeal; they offered a job as a prison guard (which I turned down). I was living paycheck to paycheck, so I had to move. I was homeless for 6 months. I lived in a car; after that, a tent. My transcripts are encumbered; my student loans are in default. I hired into a hospital so they would pay for paramedic training. I now make $30K/year as a medic, but am still living paycheck to paycheck with 2 teenagers. I want to return to college, but can&#8217;t afford to pay off the past. My kids are almost college age themselves. I do not qualify for welfare, yet have never owned a home. A prior bankruptcy had no credit cards, only utility and medical bills. I respond to 911 calls across the economic spectrum, but can&#8217;t pay my own debt. I help others in distress, but can&#8217;t find help for my family. I am juggling payday loans. I have made my share of bad decisions, but I can&#8217;t climb out of this hole. My sisters think I am a family model of success, despite always swimming upstream to avoid drowning.

Because his condition was deemed inconvenient by his superiors, he was administrativly seperated under honorable conditions so they didn&#8217;t have to give him his GI bill. When he got out, the only job he could find with no experience on the outside was as a night security gaurd for a bank. He makes 9 an hour.</p><p>I make 13 as an office coding specialist-was making 9 for a private ambulance company (make more as a receptionist then as an EMT). My EMT got me a star on my resume, but I&#8217;m told in this state you have to be a paramedic to get hired on with a paid department. We can&#8217;t afford for me to to back to school. We&#8217;re barely scraping by, and can&#8217;t afford the 480 dollars a month for health insurance.</p><p>Our baby is now 2. The tires on my car need replacing, but we can&#8217;t afford them or risk not being able to pay the rent. I pray every day that if something bad happens to me, it&#8217;s at least in the Line of Duty so that my daughter gets *something*.</p><p>My husband still cries at night. &#8221; I&#8217;m a Loadmaster, damnit&#8221;,  bue he&#8217;ll never fly again. He&#8217;s always worried about money and I&#8217;m scared for all of us. We have nothing left after groceries, daycare, food, rent, and the utilities. I fear my daughter won&#8217;t have the future I wish I could give her.</p><p>We are the 99%</p>"

Monthly income: $1000. Monthly Bills: $600-$1000 a month (depending on what I want to actually pay that month) $285 for student loans alone&#8230; my sister, eight years older then I am, pays $50&#8230;. I&#8217;m forced to live with my parents, which is an unhealthy environment for me and my son.</p><p>MAXIMUM amount of monthly income to qualify for state health insurance: $399. Last time I had health insurance, I was in highschool.</p><p>I work at home for rich clients who refuse to pay their bills, even though we&#8217;ve given them a 30% discount on what I call the &#8220;dollar store of web development companies&#8221;, and think they have the right to treat you like their slave.</p><p>I get no credit, nor do I get paid for, my time spent software engineering, improving client&#8217;s businesses with MY ideas, troubleshooting, solving business issues or consulting. I make almost $15,000/year for a job I should be getting twice as much for.</p><p>I have an IQ of 140. I graduated with a 3.95 GPA in computer science, the only reason it was this low was because I had an issue with a teacher that gave me a bad grade. He was later fired, I wasn&#8217;t the only one with an issue with him&#8230;.. How well I did in school, or how smart I am on technical tasks&#8230; means nothing.</p><p>I struggle with social anxiety and depression. I can&#8217;t make eye contact and do not do well in social situations with strangers, especially job interviews. Cheap medications, that aren&#8217;t working, is a necessary monthly bill.</p><p>I am over 100 lbs overweight and have pre-diabetes and heart disease with no health insurance or care. I have no energy to diet or exercise and have an overly rambunctious three year old to keep track of and make sure he&#8217;s not trying to jump out the second story window again today while I attempt to work.</p><p>I&#8217;ve had surgery on my right hand twice, once for carpal tunnel release, the second, to fix the first surgery, which was botched by an inexperienced doctor, whom I still owe. I have about 20% use of my hands. I was denied workman&#8217;s comp for life, they offered $500 to pay for the lawyer, which he waived, I had to sign the papers, 6 months later, because I had been unemployed for over 3 years already and needed the money.</p><p>I feel I have maybe 3-5 more years before I cannot use my hands anymore and am forced to file disability. The idea of this disgusts me. Physcial therapy could extend that to at least 20 years&#8230; there is no assistance available to do this.</p><p>I am $60,000 in student loan debt. $225 out of the $285 monthly bill is purely for interest. $20,000 of those loans, that aren&#8217;t federal, haven&#8217;t been paid on for 8 years, I am hoping no one notices. If you&#8217;re in default, you are not eligible for the income based repayment plan which could make them below $100 a month&#8230; According to the calculator, mine would be $15/month&#8230; you need to be in recovery for a year, I paid $315 a month for a year in order to be eligible for this. This does not make sense to me. If I could have afforded to pay for the loans in the first place&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t be needing the IBR!!!!!!!!!!!! Fun fact: after delaying them for 6 years, I was only 2 months late on payment to get into default.</p><p>I have been trying for the last 4 years to save $2000 to file bankruptcy for $5000-$10000 medical debt. It still hasn&#8217;t happened.</p><p>I&#8217;m about to add thousands of dollars in medical debt for dental work for my son, who needs to see a specialist due to his age (3)&#8230;. It may be his christmas present this year. I hope he&#8217;ll appreciate it when he&#8217;s older, that is, if I pay for it, I doubt I will.</p><p>Two months ago my bank account was emptied of $1400 by court order (that i was served for 4 years ago on the day I was in labor and delivery), it took me a year to save that much, to pay for an eleven year old medical bill that was $200 to begin with. The money in my bank was mostly child support&#8230; It&#8217;s illegal for a creditor to take child support from you. I had no time or any money left to dispute it. I could not get away from work or my son, in order to file the claim that I had all of <u>7 days </u>to dispute, and I was not notified it had happened until 3 days after the fact. I was lucky I was able to pay that student loan bill that month. I had only a few dollars left in my account.</p><p>I have been trying for the last 4 years to save $2000 to file bankruptcy for $5000-$10000 medical debt. It still hasn&#8217;t happened.</p><p>I had to photoshop the text on my picture because it&#8217;s difficult to use a pen/pencil.</p><p>I don&#8217;t see myself alive 5 years from now, I fear for my son, who has no other parent.</p><p>I have a roof over my head, I have an income, I&#8217;m not full of bitterness.. most of the time.

The picture that is up is the only one I have on my pc, and it is of my mother the year she died. I will tell you my story and that of my family as well, however.</p><p>In 2002, my mother became ill and went to the doctor but because she had no insurance at the time (she and my step father hadn&#8217;t married yet) they deduced that she was just after drugs and sent her home. A few months later, after she was married thank god, my step father carried my very ill mother into the ER and they finally told her that she had cancer and that her kidneys were shutting down. They misdiagnosed her twice with the cancer: first thinking it was Hodgekins Lymphoma and then telling her it was non-hodgekins before realizing that she had one of the more rare forms of Lymphoma. It&#8217;s called Null-Cell. It&#8217;s a blend of the two Lymphoma&#8217;s above and impossible to treat. She had a 10% chance of surviving the chemo but without it, she had no chance to live. She fought for two years and battled with SS offices over getting disabilty when she had several doctors tell them she would never be able to work. They refused. Why? Because she worked the year she found out she was dying. In Dec. 2004, my mother, a woman who lived through abusive relationships, parents and fought to live through cancer succumbed to the overwhelming odds of her disease. She lived a year and a half beyond what they told her she would. The day she died, the SS office called and said they&#8217;d finally approved her because she&#8217;d been out of work for at least a year due to her cancer. I told them not to bother, she would no longer be needing the 20 years of hard factory labor she put into it.</p><p>Later that next year I was diagnosed with RA. I worked in a nursing home. I&#8217;d been working there for years. The doctor told me that I would not be able to walk by the time I was 40 if I did not do something else for a job. Something lighter perhaps, like a secretary. I couldn&#8217;t quit my job for one I had no training for so I continued. In 2007, I injured myself at work. Their doctor said it was not work related, even though I had been running round on the floor taking care of 74 patients practically by myself (the other two aides were on light duty) I tried to claim my right to a second opinion but my doctor would not see me because I owed her money. No health insurance sucks when you need it, let me tell you. I was forced to quit my job because my injury prevented me from being able to walk with out crutches for several weeks.</p><p>Honestly, now, thinking back&#8230; I&#8217;m happy I quit. If I had not quit, my brother aged 19 at the time, would most likely be dead right now. In Jan. of 2008, he had a brain aneurysm right in front of me. Scariest thing I&#8217;ve ever had happen to me and I worked in healthcare. You never think that it&#8217;ll happen to you. This kind of shit happens to everyone else but you but like my mother before him having the rarest form of cancer&#8230;. he had to have something rare too. We joke about it now sort of. We try to. I remember carrying him to the car to get him to the hospital and thinking&#8230; my mother&#8217;s baby is dying&#8230;. and I can&#8217;t do anything.</p><p>My brother has a permanent seizure disorder and an anxiety problem because of the Aneurysm. He can not be left alone because he gets about 20 seconds warning before he seizes and can only helplessly yell for help. His seizures are too dangerous to leave him on his own. He is 23. He has SSI, my mother&#8217;s SSDB and foodstamps. He&#8217;s only allowed partial benefits because he gets my mother&#8217;s SS death benefits. So he recieves about $674 a month and $90 in FS a month to live on. We live in Government Housing. According to them I&#8217;m not allowed to get a part time job, date, go outside, or take classes to improve our situation because it&#8217;s their policy that caretakers are not allowed to have their own agenda. I&#8217;m being threatened with eviction. Not him, just me because I went to classes for a semester. 4 hours a week and in which case I had someone come to the house while I was gone to stay with him. Which housing also does not allow unless they approve the person first. My brother has panic attacks around my grandmother, much less a stranger. I&#8217;m the only one he&#8217;s really comfortable with. If they evict me there is no one else and he won&#8217;t be able to handle a stranger coming in. It&#8217;s either I leave him on his own, find a bigger house (which we can&#8217;t pay the rent for) or we will both be in the street.</p><p>I am 28 years old. I have 15k in medical bills, at the moment 4k in student bills and I have no health insurance because I have to be a refugee or pregnant to qualify for medicaid. I&#8217;m not allowed FS because I&#8217;m classified as a student. I&#8217;m not allowed to work because the housing says it&#8217;s government policy that I never leave my house without my brother in tow.</p><p>My entire family is the 99%, stand the hell up.</p><p>p.s. my grandmother has worked since she was 13. She has paid her taxes, votes like a good little american, and is 72 years old. She isn&#8217;t able to retire and still works because her SS is less than she made working and can&#8217;t cover her bills. It isn&#8217;t just our gen or the next that&#8217;s paying for this&#8230;. it&#8217;s everyone.</p>"

My parents did not have the financial resources to pay for my college education (Mom was an elementary school teacher; Dad was a manager at a grocery store). I have $25K of student loan debt, plus thousands of dollars of medical debt due to two chronic illnesses.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I am about to be kicked off my parents’ health insurance. I can’t buy my own insurance because of my pre-existing conditions. I have been out of school for 3 years and I STILL cannot find a full employment job, because, according to hiring managers, I don’t have enough experience. I am stuck in a low-paying government contract position with no benefits. The company that holds my contract is skimming extra money out of my paycheck for reasons unknown, and when confronted for an explanation, told me to shut up and if I didn’t like it, find another job. Oh, and they CUT MY PAY EVEN FURTHER for speaking up. And I am trapped. I have nowhere else to go right now because I haven’t been able to get another job yet.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I did everything I was supposed to do. I went to school and got a good education. I got my degree and moved to an area where jobs are supposed to be easier to find. The only credit card I have is for my medical expenses. I live within my means; I’m not a big spender. Yet I’m still living paycheck to paycheck, and I have no idea how I’m going to continue to pay my living expenses, medical bills, and somehow find a way to pay for grad school in order to get the further skills necessary to get a “real job,” because apparently a bachelor’s degree doesn’t cut it anymore. I have sent out 120+ job applications, but have only gotten three interviews. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend helping me, I would have to move back in with my parents.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">And even though my situation is bad, I know I am still one of the lucky ones. How is any of this fair? We are hardworking Americans trying to make a decent living. We are the ones the recovery was supposed to help. Instead, big banks and corporate CEOs were bailed out, and oil companies and Wall Street bigwigs are making money hand over fist by gaming the system, and the hard working among us continue to be taken advantage of.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I AM THE 99%</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">…and I WILL NOT take this lying down anymore.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">occupywallst.org</p></p>"

I knew what I was signing up for but working an entry-level admin job (for which a high-schooler would be qualified) is not what I had in mind! I’m working hard and I’m lucky my parents’ benefits cover me but I can’t afford a car, my own apartment, etc. It will be many years before I can even THINK about owning a home. If I want to be debt-free before I move out, I’m dreaming. I have applied for over 100 jobs - for which I am qualified - and I got three interviews. I am the 99%!</span></p>"

All I&#8217;ve wanted to do since high school is to be an English teacher. I need <span>at least</span> a Bachelor&#8217;s degree to do so, which means university. I&#8217;ll be the first generation of my family to do so, and I want to be proud of that. But at $16,000 a semester, by the time I&#8217;m done with college and credentialing, I&#8217;ll have <span>at least</span> $100,000 in debt, all that so I can throw my hat into an increasingly small pool of available teaching positions, and yearly decreasing wages for teachers. I live in a state and a country that is supposed to provide the &#8220;most affordable&#8221; higher education. I&#8217;d like to own a vehicle some day, and maybe pay the rent on time just once and still be able to eat. But I can&#8217;t even get a &#8220;burger flipping&#8221; job because I&#8217;m &#8220;overqualified&#8221; and &#8220;over-educated.&#8221; Most of the people my age are the same way. We aren&#8217;t lazy, we aren&#8217;t hippies. We are passionate about what we want to do, but we don&#8217;t have much hope left that we can. We Are the 99%</p><p>I&#8217;d like to add that I&#8217;ve been told pretty much from the get-go, in relation to those degrees I&#8217;ve paid so much for, that they will be &#8220;worth less than the paper they are printed on.&#8221; This has been repeated to me many times, in the same way that common knowledge is repeated. I don&#8217;t want to accept that I&#8217;ve sunken myself in debt getting degrees I needed to have for three pieces of paper that serve no purpose except to open the gateway to more debt, and another couple of pieces of paper that by the time I&#8217;m done with University will be about the same.</p><p>There&#8217;s this assumption that people make that those of us that go to community college are just wasting our time and resources. That those of us that choose to drop out lose very little in the process. I beg to differ. There are a lot of people who were told in High School that Community level college was the way to go in regards to affordability in getting the general education requirements for a degree out of the way. In addition, we were led to believe that by acquiring that general education, it would ensure us entrance to a higher level college that so many of us could not afford and weren&#8217;t eligible for scholarships for at the time. Sound familiar? We got led by the nose here, and to give up the pursuit in favor of change that, let&#8217;s be completely honest, might not come about is truly a sacrifice that I can respect. Financial aid was designed to help those students who cannot balance a job and schooling. But many of us discovered, as I did, that even with a job, financial aid, and loans, it&#8217;s not enough. I managed three years in a run-down apartment, eating basically mac-and-cheese all the time with three other people, and I still could never pay the bills on time. I tell people that because there seems to be a curious assumption that we are somehow coasting on our parent&#8217;s money and time. Hate to break the hard news, but average cost of living where I am, and this is with no internet and no phone, is still over $1000. I am willing to bet hard cash, which I have very little of now, that it&#8217;s the same situation in more than just my town.</p><p>But what hurts the worst is knowing that I&#8217;m not the only one who is sailing in this sinking boat. I know so many of my peers what are just as passionate, just as educated, and just as motivated to succeed as I am and as anyone I&#8217;ve ever known.

I knew it was completely out of my budget, with no college fund set up for me, and a family that couldn&#8217;t help pay for my education, but I decided to take the leap regardless because I know that in America, the name on your degree MATTERS. 2 years later, I can no longer afford the school and my parents can no longer cosign my loans due to bad credit scores. Despite almost $40,000 total in scholarships, I still owe over $100,000 in student loans for those 2 years ALONE. I am now attending and will graduate from a state university that I commute to daily. I live at home, a different home from where I grow up in. After 20 years of living in a moderately-sized 3-bedroom house for a 6-person family, we had to move temporarily to a cheaper rented house so we could put ours on the market. Despite setting a very low buying point, we have had no takers. If nobody buys the house within the next month or so, it will be foreclosed on, and the investment of the past 20 years will be gone. We can&#8217;t afford to rent here for long either, so I don&#8217;t know where my family (of 6, may I remind you) will go.</p><p>I am LUCKY, and STILL SCREWED and TERRIFIED for my future! This is what the 99% is about. When you work as hard as my parents, paying to LIVE should not be this difficult. I&#8217;m not religious, but I still pray that I&#8217;ll be able to get a job out of college that will allow me to repay my loans while affording to move out on my own. I network with companies when possible and strive for perfect grades in school. I&#8217;m still not counting on it.</p><p>We are the 99%. occupytogether.org</p>"

Otherwise, both his disabled wife and he will be homeless again. As a spring graduate with a 3.19 GPA in the English Education field, I am completely maxed out on loans after only 4 years of college. With education budget cuts, it is almost impossible to receive scholarships that I try to apply for every semester. Now my pell grant is almost nonexistent and unavailable in the summer. This country will pay me low wages to work extremely hard to teach high school students. The benefits I should receive may not exist later on. As a lesbian, I will be persuaded to closet myself to keep my career. My rights to a family, adoption, partner benefits, and marriage will be ignored and denied. As a feminist, I will worry about my rights to control my uterus. I&#8217;m scared about my future because I know no one is representing me. I succeeded in college to live a life of debt. Why am I (and my family) invisible to our government? We are the 99%. </p>"

Our home is 38 years old, falling apart, and has mold.  We can&#8217;t afford to get rid of the mold, fix our crumbling roof, outdated electrical system, or dry rotted siding.  Our patio door has been boarded up since last year when someone shattered it breaking into our home.  We didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t have homeowners&#8217; insurance or money to replace it.  And I work full-time!  My mother receives Social Security (she&#8217;s a senior), but it&#8217;s not enough.  Because of her age, my mother also receives Medicaid, but they subtract the costs from her Social Security payment!  WTF?!  It was already reduced because she got it before she turned 65.  She really had no choice because she couldn&#8217;t find a decent job.  My boyfriend is ex-military, but was denied VA Benefits because he didn&#8217;t go to war.  He&#8217;s got an enlarged heart, hypertension, and needs a kidney transplant.  S.S. and Medicaid are denying his claim.  Meanwhile politicians receive pensions and heathcare for LIFE! Even after they exit office! </p><p>What little my mother gets from Social Security does help, but she needs a steady full-time job.  She hasn&#8217;t had one in 3 years.  Not that she should be working at all.  My mother is 67 years old!  When she should be enjoying her &#8220;golden years&#8221; and grandkids, she&#8217;s still on the grind like everyone else looking for work.  I read on CNN Money yesterday where some writer said the colleges and universities are to blame because everyone keeps posting about their student loan debt.  Well, that is, when they bother to cover our &#8220;occupation&#8221; on the news at all.  But the writer totally missed the point.  Colleges didn&#8217;t gamble our retirement savings away playing the terrible and unpredictable odds of the stock market!  They didn&#8217;t cause the housing crisis!  They didn&#8217;t hand over our taxes to bailout the banks, auto industry, AIG, and Wall Street!  They haven&#8217;t kept us in 2 wars with no end in sight, and no job prospects for troops when they return home!  CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT, AND WALL STREET did.  Some say this is our fault and we shouldn&#8217;t be asking for &#8220;handouts&#8221;.  But since when are jobs, affordable education, the ability to start a family, a clean environment, medical care, food and shelter &#8220;handouts&#8221;??? </p><p>The American Dream has become The American Horror Story.  Everyday many of the 99% live in fear.  I fear that I will be arrested, put in jail, and lose my job for the outstanding traffic tickets and suspended license I can&#8217;t afford to pay.  I fear the IRS, or some other corporation or bank that ALREADY RECEIVED OUR TAXPAYER MONEY in the form of bailouts will garnish my check for an outstanding bill I can&#8217;t afford.  I fear what&#8217;s happening to me and my mother&#8217;s health because of the mold growing in our home.  I fear that we could have a fire, flood, or tree damage and lose what we have left because we can&#8217;t afford homeowner&#8217;s insurance (tall pine trees are the norm here).  I fear that someone will break into our home again (for the 3RD TIME) and cause more damage we can&#8217;t afford to fix.  I fear that one day I will get laid off from my job because the furloughs and rising costs of running the university where I work won&#8217;t be enough to keep me employed.  </p><p>I look at my 11 y.o. son and recognize that sparkle in his eyes.  I used to have that when I was his age.  I believed (and was told) that if you work hard you can do anything, be anything, accomplish anything.  How can I look him in the eyes and say that to him when I don&#8217;t believe it myself???  I breaks my heart.  Thats what the 1% has taken from me.  From him.  From my mother.  From all of us.  </p><p>They say the most dangerous (wo)man is one that has nothing to lose.  Clearly the 1% doesn&#8217;t realize this, or worse yet, they don&#8217;t care.  Well we (the 99%) can show them better than we can tell them!!  WE&#8217;RE DONE!!!</p>"

we have not bought gifts for ourselves, friends, or family in years; and we do what we can to not live beyond our means, yet each month there just isn’t enough.  We have downsized our bills and services as much as possible, but we still have to resort to using credit cards to ensure that our two kids have a roof over their heads and hot food to eat.  However, even our credit card balances are getting closer and closer to their limits.  We will exhaust our “safety net” by the Spring of 2012.  What do we do then?  Sell our home that we are completely upside down on, thus losing our $40K down payment…and still owe the bank money on it.  Then where would we live?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">My wife is the only person in the family with healthcare insurance.  While I am thankful that her employer, an attorney, offers a benefit to his employees, every single day I worry about our children daughter being exposed to the physical dangers and diseases of the world, but we cannot afford the additional $800/per month insurance premiums for family coverage.  We are one medical emergency or hospitalization away from complete financial failure.  My wife’s employer recently downgraded their healthcare insurance policy to one that has a decrease in coverage by thousands and increased the deductibles hundreds to help save the office literally less than $30 for each employee.  Yet, her employer is admittedly having “the best year.”  Her employer does this without any regret, remorse, or seemingly without any awareness of how this might impact his employees.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Our financial situation has caused stress, anxiety, and depression beyond description.  I fear that our marriage may not survive this crisis.  Bankruptcy is a definite possibility at this point.  We have worked really hard to keep our high credit scores and now something that is completely out of our control could ruin it.  If things are this bad now, what will it be like when my unemployed benefits run out?  I can’t and don’t want to imagine that future.   What do I tell my children when they ask about getting an education and working hard?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">I have lost hope.  I don’t know what to do.  What I do know is this: I want to provide for my family, but I cannot.  I do not want a handout – I just want a chance.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style=""font-size: 16pt;"">My family &amp;

I have tried to seek assistance with state and local agents with little or no luck. After being turned down I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain. After seeking treatment for addictive traits I found there is a deep seeded problem, bi-polar disorder and often bouts of schizophrenia. With out income I can&#8217;t find a doctor or a treatment plan for the mental illness. With the illness I find it hard to work or hold a job. Not having income I can&#8217;t support my children whom I love deeply and don&#8217;t  see them due to my having a valid drivers  license.

We can&#8217;t afford the more expensive online high school diplomas. Because of that, there is no hope for either of us to get a GED right now. We aren&#8217;t lazy. We want to go to college, but are afraid that it would just put us in debt.</p><p>I sit at home and pass the time by doing any volunteer work I can do online in an attempt to keep myself busy and to keep my depression at bay. I had hoped that this would look good for when I try to get a job, also, but it&#8217;s impossible to throw that in there when everywhere requires a GED or higher and nowhere will call me back.</p><p>My boyfriend also had his salary cut a few months ago, around the same time our car broke down. He is lucky - he works with his uncle, so he has a ride to work. But we don&#8217;t have the money to pay for a reliable vehicle, and we definitely don&#8217;t have the money to throw away on a vehicle that will only last us a month. So we&#8217;re waiting. Hoping something improves before things get worse.</p><p>I feel like we&#8217;re stuck in quicksand - we&#8217;re sinking fast with no way out. We need a car. I need a job. But how is that going to happen? My boyfriend is forced to do work at his job that he isn&#8217;t even paid for, but he can&#8217;t complain for fear of losing his job - even though we really need that extra money. But we&#8217;re lucky. We can still afford food and a roof over our heads. We just have nothing left at the end of the month to get ahead. We&#8217;re only falling farther and farther behind. We&#8217;re only 22. We aren&#8217;t criminals. We aren&#8217;t greedy. We donate when we can, and we&#8217;re always lending a helping hand to people in need. All we did wrong was drop out of high school, and we want so badly to correct that but we can&#8217;t. Then we see others who have made no mistakes at all, but are worse off than we are and it makes us wonder&#8230; is there even a light at the end of the tunnel?</p><p>My boyfriend and I are the 99%</p><p>Occupywallst.org</p>"

I only went to the ALC 3 hours a day, yet I only graduated a month later then my friends and peers. I have had a job at a family owed restaurant for almost 3 years now. I make a decent amount of money for a kid my age which I am very grateful for. I will be starting school this January at a community college. I have qualified for the pell grant since both my parents have been laid off within the past 3 years. Luckily they both have jobs&#8230; for now. It was a little rough but our family made it. My heart goes out to all the others who are in those situations now. I am scared for my future and I feel like I will be wasting my time going to college. I just don&#8217;t see a future in any careers right now. Sadly, the American dream is a lie. But we can restore hope with these movements and protests. Solidarity! </p>"

My mom, who has worked so hard, now has to file bankruptcy just so that she can get back up on her feet.

He worked over 40 hours a week and broke his back, not literally, for this job. When GM shut down, he was qualified to get a retirement package. About a year ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

But facing the distinct possibility that I may never build upon the dreams and aspirations of my parents and pass them onto children of my own scares me to my core.

My dog was left behind at 5 weeks old in a foreclosed home. My brother was left caring for my dying mother while unemployed for 9 months in Michigan. I was lucky to have left there early enough so now I take the small excess I have to try and make a home for the three of us. This isn&#8217;t how it was supposed to be. I am the 99 percent.

I have a Ph.D. I’ve never made more than $38,000 a year. I haven’t worked full-time in two 1/2 years. I have paid $438/month on a student loan for the past 17 years (13 more to go). I can’t afford health insurance. My unemployment runs out soon.<br/>Since being laid off, I’ve duct-taped severe wounds that needed stitches and slaughtered chickens at home to lower my food bills. <br/>A healthy society would use my talents and education (which I and once-generous grantors paid for) to build a stronger, more productive country. Today’s America treats me like dirt.<br/>There are no jobs within hundreds of miles of my house that make good use of my training or skills. If somebody did want to hire me - an overqualified older worker – as minimum-wage stockclerk or secretarial temp, the pay wouldn’t cover my bills and student loan debt.<br/>I don’t want a bailout. I don’t want tax cuts. People rant at me all the time: “we need less government.” I don’t want that. I want my government back.<br/>The corrupt, flagrantly irresponsible, non-financial geniuses who destroyed our economy got bailouts and bonuses. <br/>The government fails to hold mortgage lenders and investment bank shareholders liable for the losses they caused. But it requires me to pay back my loans – some at excessive interest rates.<br/>A Sallie-Mae-lobbied law, for example, has banned me from refinancing my 30-year, $50,000, 8-percent student loan for the past 17 years. Mortgage rates have been much lower the entire time.  A refi – say from 8 to 6 percent &#8212; would have saved me $24,000 in interest payments. (I’ll pay a total of about $82,000). (Who gets this money? Sallie Mae).<br/>If I miss a monthly GSL payment, the law lets lenders add the unpaid interest to the principal. Then they charge interest on the ever-higher total amount. The law bans me from bankrupting out of the loan. If I can’t find enough work that pays well enough once unemployment runs out in January, I’ll pay on this loan ‘til I die.<br/>The speculating bankers and conman lenders cost me a 5-year investment of tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of labor fixing up my home. When I married in ’08 and moved out, the crash cost me the $20,000 I’d invested in lost equity. I can’t get rid of the $45/month mortgage insurance payment now – my equity keeps falling. I had to rent the house to survive. And then I didn’t qualify for the federal energy-efficiency tax deduction given to homeowners – because it wasn’t offered to landlords. <br/>Meanwhile, in America, power and wealth become ever more concentrated at the top. Wealth is more equally distributed in Guyana, Nicaragua, and Venezuela than it is here. <br/>I am the 99 percent.<br/>occupywallstreet.org</p>"

I have just received my paralegal certificate, but am having a bit of a hard time finding a job here in Austin, Texas. The job market down here seems to have evaporated rather quickly, since we have a $27 billion+ budget shortfall in  this state, and a lot of of the jobs here in the capital are government jobs that are on the chopping block.</p><p>But, whatever you do, don&#8217;t tell that to my Governor, Rick Perry. He&#8217;s too busy perpetually running for office to give two craps about me. He is currently running for President of the United States of America, less than 1 year after getting re-elected to his fourth consecutive term as Governor. During this legislative session, there was much debate over releasing money from a state rainy-day fund to pay for state workers&#8217; jobs. Perry said that he would veto any measure that involved releasing the said fund that came his way, because he is afraid the truth behind his &#8220;job creation&#8221; record will come to a head. As a result, 49,000+ teachers, among thousands of other state workers, here have lost their jobs.</p><p>But, <strong>at least</strong> under Gov. Perry&#8217;s watch, there are plenty of McDonald&#8217;s and Wal-Mart jobs, as long as you don&#8217;t mind living with your parents, and as long as they don&#8217;t mind you living with them.</p><p>I have looked at paralegal job postings on Craigslist every day, and just about all of them have said something along the lines of &#8220;$9-13/hour with 3-5 years experience&#8221;. Seriously?! Get real, employers! The saying &#8220;you have to take what you can get&#8221; should work both ways. If I can&#8217;t negotiate my salary upwards, you can;t demand I have 3-5 years experience to go with that salary. If you go to a car dealership and say that because &#8220;we&#8217;re in a recession&#8221;, you should be able to buy a brand new Mercedes-Benz for the price of a used KIA, you&#8217;re just going to be laughed off the lot.</p><p>i am 24 years old, I have Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, and although I am physically healthy, I have to be careful for later as diabetes and high blood-pressure run in my family.</p><p>One day, a few months ago, as I was riding home on the bus from my internship at a law firm downtown, the bus driver told me that his friend, another paralegal, made less money than he did. WTF?! Paralegals make less money than bus drivers?! The reason for this, according to the bus driver, was because a lot of the duties the paralegal used to do can now be done automatically by by computer. Nice to know, as I am getting close to graduating from my program, that my job may very well become obsolete over the next few years.</p><p>I am the 99%, but you won&#8217;t see me on OWS, since traveling to NYC isn&#8217;t in my budget.</p>"

There is no &#8216;care&#8217; there anymore). I made 12.50 an hour doing the jobs of 3 people, with no benefits and the so-called &#8216;company insurance&#8217; was routinely cut off for no reason. I lasted a year and 7 months before I had to quit due to illness. I was sick for months with simple infections because I could not afford the medication to treat them. I now have a bleeding ulcer, severe depression, insomnia, and asthma; all of which are going untreated because I cannot afford the meds. I have contemplated suicide 10 times over the past 2 weeks and am in severe pain whenever I so much as take a sip of water.

Right before Christmas of 2008 my husband was wrongfully terminated for having to take a few days off work after I had a miscarriage. They legally had to give him his position back but not until we threatened to get a lawyer. This was a company known only in our house as &#8220;Evilmart&#8221;, because they then told him that they made a mistake and he would not be receiving a pay check.

We&#8217;re very lucky to have the friends we do. I became disabled after I had our second child because of conditions I was born with. Later that year my husband was fired again, but this time, for good. 4 months later in January of 2010my 2 and 1/2 year old son had his leg viciously broken by my sister&#8217;s,now, ex-boyfriend. When I had a mental break down and had to drop the classes I was in, my college wouldn&#8217;t waive the tuition fees and I can&#8217;t go back until I pay them. I was 3 classes away from my Associates Degree in Psychology. I now have $26,000 in defaulted student loans and no way to pay them back or finish college. My husband has been unemployed for the last 2 years because he couldn&#8217;t find a job and exhausted all his unemployment benefits. Now he has to stay home and take care of me because I need constant care and we can&#8217;t afford child care. Our income totals $1,012 a Month. We get food stamps but it&#8217;s never enough to feed our family of 4. We can&#8217;t even afford our own place to live.</p><p>We are the 99%</p>"

I have a roof over my head, food on my table and a job even if it is part-time and for all these little things I am grateful&#8230;but aren&#8217;t these suppose to be the basics?</p><p>What happened to the American dream that lead thousands of immigrants here so very long ago? A once beautiful dream that is now dying under the greed of financial gain from heartless corporations that currently run our once proud country. But now you drown in debt from trying to achieve higher education, work any job you can get a hold of and hope that you can make it through till payday, good honest people are loosing their homes and cars and even some are loosing their hope. I am proud to be part of this movement, and I support it 100% whether is triumphs or fails I can tell my daughter that I was part of this movement</p>"

I lost my job for a petty reason so my supervisor would ensure that she would have a job after the state agency &#8220;reorganized&#8221; itself. As it turns out, in Texas, they can fire you for not wearing the right color nail polish; however, that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t qualify for unemployment&#8230; Does that save the agency money? I think not. </p>"

My husband has fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. His pay JUST covers the expenses for a family of 3.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>I just graduated college in May. I earned a 4.0 GPA, went to an ABA-Approved paralegal program, and did a semester-long internship with the county. However, now I cannot find a job. “Entry-level” jobs are going to people with 5+ years of experience. (WHAT??) I have even applied to be a file clerk at multiple firms. They told me that they have ATTORNEYS applying for the same positions. How can I compete with that? I am now considering going back to retail- back to minimum wage. It is better than NO wage. I would go back to school, but I have drained my savings in order to get THIS degree. Right now, spending more on school would mean loans and that seems silly, given I have had no return on my initial investment. I’d like to be able to tell my 11 year old that college is the best way to secure a bright future for herself. I thought that by going back to school I would be a good role model for her. Now, I’m not so sure. This may have taught her that college is a waste of money.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Thank God my husband still has a job and that it provides health insurance! Without that we would be homeless right now. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>So it is deeply offensive when our politicians hold military pay hostage as a bargaining chip to keep tax cuts for the rich. (Oh, I’m sorry, “Job Creators”) (Wait…then where is MY job?)<span>  </span>The last time they did that, my husband was in Libya. He was worried that we might not get paid, might get evicted, all while he fought in yet one more war. We love our country. We WANT to believe in its leaders. But they have to inspire trust. Inspire faith. Right now they do not.</span></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst""><span><span>·<span>         </span></span></span><strong><span>We are the 99%</span></strong><span> and we demand leaders who are not puppets for corporations.</span></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span><span>·<span>         </span></span></span><span>We demand politicians who are not so far to the right OR left that they can compromise and work together to find solutions to our country’s problems.</span></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span><span>·<span>         </span></span></span><span>We demand job creation, investment in public education, and health insurance reform.</span></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast""><span><span>·<span>         </span></span></span><span>We want hope. We want to be able to support our families. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The American Dream is not to become rich. It is to see the fruit of your labors, whatever they may be. It is to EARN your rewards. But Corporate America has taken the rewards away. All that is left is work and desperation. (Or no work, and even more desperation) A home, health insurance, providing for your children, giving them a future…those things SHOULD be attainable.<span>  </span>But unions are gone or ineffective. Politicians are corrupt. The Supreme Court values the speech of corporations over those of the people. <span> </span>Jobs are taken overseas.<span>  </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>“These are the times that try men’s souls.” Thomas Paine said that. <span> </span>He also said, &#8220;If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace.&#8221;<span>  </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span><span>                </span>So if MY labors must go unrewarded, so be it. But now, let us come together to find a solution. Let us make the country better for our children. I want to tell my child, “Go to college. Better yourself. Provide for YOUR family. Serve your country in whatever way you can.” We have to work together to keep the American Dream alive.</span></p><p

We have to re-empower the government to oversee corporations so that we can re-establish our goals to protect and nurture our planet.

Where the only hope for humanity, apparently, rests in the hands of a few corporate mogul mavericks, who will save us from our own gross inefficiencies and unfortunate tendency to care about each other. And if they should absorb 90% of the nation’s wealth in the process, well, that’s just the American way, right? IT DOESN’T EVEN ENTER THE DIALOG that Americans could cooperatively establish any goals beyond individual monetary profit.</span></p>"

And when its hard for her, its hard for me.</p><p>She has been unemployed not for quite a few years ever since the factory she worked at so conveniently moved out of state. She&#8217;s been living off unemployment since then while job hunting. Still no job offers and those unemployment benefits cut off January 1st, 2012. Then she&#8217;ll be living off of the money she gets monthly thats my sisters and I. We may live in section 8, but its a 3 bedroom apartment and its pretty fucking pricey. She&#8217;s gone to speak to them so many times and they just won&#8217;t lower it. She pays phone bills (which is a necessity, we dont have a house phone because this way we could all just contact each other at any time), light, credit cards, and so much more shit thats shes in her ass with the amount of payments she has to make. Not to mention my sister should be going to college this spring. My mom&#8217;s paying for SATs and applications, and all sorts of educational things. And next year, the process will come again, but for me.</p><p>The worst part? Everyday she mentions her strife. And then I just sit there in silence. Not knowing what to say. I don&#8217;t know how to comfort nor help her, I have no income and no matter how much research I have on the matter, I wont know how it feels until I&#8217;m living the struggle. But then she says, as if to reassure me, &#8220;But its okay, I know I&#8217;m going to figure this out&#8221;. And she goes on with a plan of how, while I know shes really just saying it to reassure herself. She wants to be a part of occupywallst but I don&#8217;t let her go out to those streets because of the arrests and such that take place.</p><p>I used to be the person who would see a homeless person and never give them change. In my eyes, they put themselves in that position. It was nobodys fault but their own. But this movement opened my eyes. Nobody plans things like that. People dont say at the age of the 5 that they want to live on the street with no career, living a life of regrets and if only and what ifs. But it happens. Some people end up like that because they screwed themselves over, and some were screwed by the government and others. Now I drop change in their cups. Whether they go and spend it on liquor is their decision to make, and if they wash away their daily street savings on that, then its their fault. But, I did my part in helping them because one day, it could be me.</p><p>I realized this yesterday when having a conversation with two of my friends on facebook. Everything that we are fighting for, is what Karl Marx spoke about in &#8220;The Communist Manifesto&#8221;. We are the Proletariat. Now I am not anti-capitalism nor am I pro-communism, but the government we have now is not working out. I mean, how long could a Capitalist society last? With this capitalist society, its no wonder that society has grown to be greedy and wicked from birth. And maybe its not to blame capitalism, but just our government. And soon enough, if the people don&#8217;t get what we want, I think we might turn to the Declaration of Independence and rise against the governments thats not currently working on helping out its people. But with our government, they would probably disregard that and kill us off by shooting down our efforts. Thats what they&#8217;re doing now with the arrests and the beatings of Wall Street Occupiers. And they speak of what they will do with and/or for us, but the clock is ticking and we can only wait so long. The longer we wait, the worse the economy gets, and the worse the rebellions will be. WE the people of the UNITED states of america should be working TOGETHER with the government. &#8220;United we stand, divided we fall&#8221;, remember that? But people who are doing fine, they dont care. Since they&#8217;re doing well, they wont dare help us. When in reality, the pain of one fellow american should cause pain in us all. And the fact that this is the majority of Americans who are suffering so much and still receiving little support from those who don&#8217;t relate is just sad. At any minute, anybody could fall into the 99%, and so instead of having such a division and inequality that separates us all into categories of such percentages, we should ALL as a whole and as a nation, look towards a 100%. We don&#8217;t have to all be working the same nor being paid the same, but, having the same chance at an equal life between everyone. That is not what we have now and there is no reason for such discord.</p><p>I am the 99%</p><p>occupywallst.org</p>"

The way I see it, I have 3 options: I can continue to study and create more debt, knowing it is unlikely I will be able to get a job using my degree in NZ; I can stop studying and work in my minimum wage job which offers barely enough money to pay the rent and eat at the same time; Or, I can support social change. </p><p>I am the 99%</p>"

I fell behind 4 payments on my mortgage and am now facing foreclosure because I was unemployed for almost 6 months. I am scared. I owe back child support and am trying to decide every month if I should pay that or my car payment. My ex husband and I share our children 50/50 joint custody but I have to pay for health and dental insurance plus child support because, historically I have always made more money than him. He works for his family business. I have medical bills and prescriptions that I cannot afford, but also cannot afford not to take. I have chronic back pain and surgery was recommended, but the insurance plan I was on would not cover it. I cannot afford to pay for the surgery as it would cost as much as my car! I have 2 retirement accounts that I cannot touch because my ex husband won&#8217;t make a decision about whether to take his half with a penalty or make a retirement account in his name. Our divorce was supposed to be finalized in 2008.  I could have avoided the bankruptcy if I were able to just take my half of MY retirement that I worked for.  I would take the penalty to get out of this financial rut I am in. There is no help out there for me. My family members all are in a similar situation. For 6 years I worked 2 jobs and still could not get out of debt. I have 4 children and I cannot afford to send them to college. They do not participate in extracurricular activities because I cannot afford the uniforms, fees or equipment required. I cannot afford a land line phone in my home. I cannot afford to buy my children winter coats this year or shoes despite the fact that I now have a job. I am so very scared that something will happen to my job. I have spent my last 4 paychecks trying to catch up on my mortgage so I don&#8217;t lose my house and have fallen behind on my child support. I have to travel to another city to work and drive 40 miles/day. After my mortgage payment goes through this month, I will be left with about $200 in my checking and savings accounts combined. If I make my child support payment, that check will bounce and I will have nothing left. My children will go hungry, my gas and electric will get turned off, I will not be able to pay for my medications. I never thought that as a Registered Nurse I would ever find myself in this situation. It is depressing and frustrating and no one out there has any patience; they want their money NOW. I pay my taxes and am honest about my income. The poor get poorer, the middle class gets poorer and the rich continue to get richer with all kinds of loopholes in tax laws to help them stay that way. You can&#8217;t take it with you folks and you are raising spoiled brats who squander your riches and flaunt it with a blatant disregard for the homeless man they walk by and make nasty remarks about his status and hygiene. The world is dying so the rich can get richer. Society has become a throw-away place, where even people become the trash.  I work long hours and so much of my income gets taken away. I don&#8217;t think there will be social security for me. My children will only see it if I die while they are still minors. What a messed up world! It sickens me that those who have are able to close their eyes to the have-nots.</p><p>Those in government have forgotten their role as a public servant who is supposed to be working for the people&#8230; who is supposed to be the voice of the people.  I think they should all be working for minimum wage and either have the crappy medical insurance the rest of us have if we are lucky enough to get it or have none at all like so many out there.  They should have to patch the holes in their clothing and darn their socks and have to have their shoes resoled or patched up with cardboard and duct tape.  They should be given a small, under $20K car to drive around and have to pay for their entertainment out of pocket like the rest of us do. The working person has been forgotten unless it is time for your vote. </p><p>I am the 99 percent</p><p>occupywallst.org</p>"

Unfair treatment to the employees, long hours with NO breaks, mandatory 16-hour days and constantly understaffing.  I put in a two-week notice and got my old job back.  I was denied my accrued vacation time from my previous job, even with a two-week notice.

My parents, who worked blue collar jobs, could not provide much support for my education so I chose state school knowing that I would have to pay the debt in full.

Two years and no raises later, they offered to pay for my MBA through their program at the business school.

But did not realize it until now. I got married young, yeah I made a mistake, and put off finishing school, until now. I am getting my GED, so that MAYBE I can get a job. In February I lost my job. They say they fired me, unemployment says I quit. Too late to fight for money. I have a 4 year old daughter who needs clothes, she grows fast. We lost our son a week before I supposed to have him. Doctors fault, no money to sue them. Because we have a child, we get state health insurance, and food stamps. It&#8217;s enough food for a month, if I don&#8217;t make big meal (ex. meat loaf, mashed potatoes, green beans, and whatever fruit we have) and if we don&#8217;t shop at name brand groceries. Health insurance pays for everything for my daughter. However, my husband is disabled, and cannot work. They will not pay for him to go see a neurologist, like he needs to, unless he gets a referral. But after he was told to go see one, he got into a car wreck, which made everything worse, so he went back to his doctor, to get some pain meds until he could get into see one. Since there is a car wreck on medical history, none of the neurologists here will see him. He has been denied disability, because he has not went to see one. We get $290 a month in cash assistants, our rent alone is $625. Cheapest we could find, that my daughter has her own room. Luckily we have family that helps us. They are running low on their funds. All of this is taking its mental, physical, and emotional damage on us. My daughter wears hand-me-down clothes, because we cannot afford to get her new clothes. They are all clothes that others have grown out of. And a lot of them do not look nice (stains, rips, falling apart). She needs shoes, and I hate making her wear used shoes. Winter is coming, and I will not let her wear hats worn by others for worries that she might get lice, and that will be another bill we will have to pay. We were given a truck, that is made for two, we have to make work with my daughters booster seat. It&#8217;s a manual, and since I am so short, my husband has to drive every where. It&#8217;s getting to the point now that if we have to go some where, or do something, either I have to go, and leave him at home, or we get our his wheelchair, and walk. We need a car, that is not falling apart. His parents have replaced two tires on the truck both of them being the same tire, and we still need three more tires. The transmission is freezing up. The e-break does not work any more. We are tired, over worked, and FED UP!!! We are the 99%</p>"

I take 18 credit hours (i&#8217;m required to take 15+ and have a minimum 3.0 gpa to keep my state scholarship and grant; without it, my dream of higher education is over). My family&#8217;s combined income is &lt;$32000 dollars a year, but the only financial aid I qualify for from the government is a $5500 unsubsidized loan because my father had to liquidate his entire 401k to pay off the mortgage on our house, driving our income up to &gt;$80000 (a mortgage that my parents paid on for 20 years without fault, but they began foreclosure proceedings on after missing 1 payment). My father was laid off after working for 20 years at his company, but ran a fairly successful lawn care business for several years after. 6 years ago, he had to shut it down as our state&#8217;s unemployment shot up 14% and no one could afford the extremity of lawn care. MY FATHER HAS A COLLEGE EDUCATION. My mother works 40 hours a week at a SHIT job that she hates, that she has developed several illnesses from, just to keep our benefits; she doesn&#8217;t even make enough to cover the bills.

Now, a year after returning stateside, I have $40.00 to my name, I work a part time job  making $10.00/hr. I owe my landlord two months back rent, and unless I come up with something quick, they will shut my power off soon. I have sold off belongings (music instruments etc.) throughout the year to try to keep afloat, but now I don&#8217;t have any more stuff to sell. <br/><br/>The financial stress of this past year has made me lose my self-esteem and confidence. In turn, this has led to strife in my family, and last week my girlfriend took our 2&#160;1/2 year old daughter and moved out. She still believes in the American dream; she has been brainwashed to think that all you need is a job and then you&#8217;ll be OK somehow, even if the job pays $10 an hour.

It thrived until just after 9/11, when all of their major clients moved out of state (I&#8217;m from NY and commute to NYC every day). By 2007, the year I graduated highschool, their business was defunct, and just a name.</li><li>My father became permanently disabled in 2008. My mother found a new job making barely minimum wage in 2008.</li><li>I started college in 2007, and I am still in today, 5 years later going for the same degree but at a different school. All the schools I went to were public. I will owe $25k when I graduate.</li><li>My mother lost her job in August and has no health insurance and no income aside from occasional odd jobs from what was left of the business. She will have a hard time finding a job because she&#8217;s bad with computers, over 50, and over qualified on the business knowledge end, and has a bachelors.</li><li>I got a job in June working in my field for just over minimum wage (after working elsewhere as an intern for free for a year, and a year of unemployment without being able to collect before, and 5 years of retail before that). I asked for a raise a few weeks ago and starting October I will have health insurance. I am VERY VERY LUCKY.</li><li>We are at risk of losing our house that we have owned for 22 years and we are also at risk of losing our utilities, any month now.</li><li>What kills me most is that my mother, who never ever cried, now cries daily. She&#8217;s extremely depressed and has bad insomnia. She feels hopeless.</li><li>My dad tried to commit suicide in August. I received a suicide note via email - he thought I was asleep. I went to the rehab facility (he is learning how to walk again after a partial foot amputation) he is in and came just in time. He was planning on ODing on sleep meds.</li><li>My parents know they are worth more dead than alive, because their life insurances allow for suicide. This terrifies me.</li></ul><p>WTF is wrong with this country that there are already 20 pages prior to this entry (at least) full of similar stories? Our constitution guarantees us the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#8230; Yet we have elected politicians on both sides who are only servants to the mega-rich who seek to remove our rights with our blind consent.

They have the education, the work ethic, and receive nothing but the bare minimum needed to survive for it, or less. They are indeed slaves to the noble class.<strong> You can’t “work your way up” if there is no way up</strong>.</p><p>But there is. And it requires a lot more bravery and a lot more work and a lot more sacrifice. If everyone in the United States were to turn off their televisions and walk outside today and chant in unison and refuse to comply until a simple demand is met, they would either have to arrest everyone (impossible) or agree to change.<br/><br/><strong>We aren’t lazy hippies asking for handouts. We are tired and sore and beaten down and angry because we do exactly as we’re told, and receive nothing but the minimum amount of money for room and board for it, the very definition of a slave.</strong><br/><br/>Even people with higher powered jobs are losing any hope of retiring, their pensions taken, and any hope to receive what they are entitled to for THEIR HARD WORK is dwindling. The top 1% act with impunity and the 99% are punished for even the slightest infraction, sometimes just for fun or “because we can”.<br/><br/>And most importantly, voting will not and does not work, because they own the politicians too. They fund the campaigns (most of the Dem/Rep campaign funds are from corporations), so you only ever see _their_ picks on TV, and then they buy them off on every important issue through lobbying, and they own the news, so you hear what they want you too. This isn’t even about getting a cut. <strong><em>NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THAT MUCH POWER</em></strong>.<br/><br/>Why do you think this hasn’t been covered by the news hardly at all, while a bullshit tea party protest of half the size with no spread to any other cities with a confused and irrational message was front page shit on just about every rag and news channel in the US?<br/><br/>I’m hopeful because <strong>people are starting to realize that freedom is about freedom, not about working forever until you die with a vague promise that you might get to do some cool stuff eventually someday, when you pay off that student loan debt. Which is impossible</strong>.<br/><br/>Oh. And <em>you don’t own anything</em>. The bank owns your house, your car, and all of your money in the bank. And now that they have person-hood, they can and will take it all when the coup is ready to go.<br/><br/>And the world banks own them.<br/><br/>In effect by transition, the world banks own<em> you</em>. And they are biding their time. And we are going to lose.<br/><br/>The only time anything has ever changed, ever REALLY changed, it changed with a revolution, and sometimes it was bloody, but it has never, EVER, in the known history of human civilization, when people mostly consented to the establishment for now, biding their time, “busting their asses,” and then losing hope, and then dying that way.<br/><br/><strong>If you don’t act right this second, with God as your witness, justice on your side, and the willing spirit to die for a cause, who will?</strong> There has to be a beginning. There has to be a first. And we will be the first. And more are following.<strong> I don’t want a handout.

I stopped there, because I’d nearly exhausted the savings my parents had for me. And by 2008, I’d seen just how far a degree would get me: deep in debt. with little chance to every pay it back. A degree has become little more than pricey slips of paper, mocking us from their frames and envelopes. It took me three and half years to get that slip of paper. I’m one of the lucky ones, with no debt. </p><p>But I also have no job. And no dreams, no this is slowly becoming a living nightmare. I had a minimum wage job, in another city, but I couldn’t support myself on $7.94 an hour. We had barely been getting by on two paychecks. Now I’m back in with mu parents, living off their generosity and my own meager savings. I’m applying to every job I can find out here. But so few places are actually hiring, and I am over-educated or under-experienced for nearly all of them. Or both.</p><p>I played by the rules. I got good grades, went to college, and got a degree. I graduated in 2009, to no prospects. Nothing for me. Fast food joints don’t even call me back.</p><p>I feel HOPELESS. I’m already depressed, untreated. I often find myself thinking of suicide, because I see no future for me. At all. The current reality depresses me more than anything else. There is nothing here for me to work towards. Nothing substantial for any of my friends either. </p><p>My best friend is pregnant with their first child. At 7 months pregnant, she lost her job. She has since been rehired, but her insurance won’t pick back up for another 45 days. She’s due in 2 weeks. His family is well off, but they’re not rich. They help, but they can’t support them completely on the medical bills. </p><p>So is that what we’re supposed to do now? Live off our parents? All of our parents are stuck as well. They’re torn between their own daily expenses and retirement funds, or supporting their grown children. Again. That is not a desicion they should be forced to make.</p><p>We all played by the rules, and we were robbed blind. <br/>We sat back in blissful ignorance, and let them do this to us.</p><p>We are the 99 percent. <br/>And we are sick of playing by these Greed-driven rules.</p></span></p>"

Are you facing the real possibility of eviction and homelessness? Are you worried that the social programs you depend on will get cut in the name of austerity? Let the 1 percent know by taking part in the 99 Percent Project. Make a sign. Write your circumstance at the top, <strong>no longer than a single sentence</strong>. Examples:</p><p>&#8220;I am a student with $25,000 in debt.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I need surgery and I&#8217;m more worried about the expense than my health.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a homeowner who&#8217;s about to face foreclosure.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Below that, write &#8220;I am the 99 percent.&#8221; </strong><br/><br/><strong>Below that, write &#8220;OccupyTogether&#8221;</strong></p><p>Then, take a picture of yourself holding the sign and submit it to us. The 99 percent have been set against each other, fighting over the crumbs the 1 percent leaves behind. But we&#8217;re all struggling. We&#8217;re all fighting. It&#8217;s time we recognize our common struggles, our common cause. Be part of the 99 percent and let the 1 percent know you&#8217;re out there.</p>"
